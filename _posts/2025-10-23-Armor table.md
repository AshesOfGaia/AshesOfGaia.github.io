## Armor Qualities

| **Quality** | **Description** |
| :---------: | :-------------: |
| **Anti-Frag** | Doubles the armor rating against weapons with **Fragmentation** trait, such as grenades, explosives, or certain heavy weapons. |
| **Enhanced Strength (X)** | Grants a bonus of **+X** to the wearer’s **Strength** stat. The value of **X** is specified in the armor’s description. |
| **Enhanced Dexterity (X)** | Grants a bonus of **+X** to the wearer’s **Dexterity** stat. The value of **X** is specified in the armor’s description. |
| **Enhanced Movement (X)** | Grants a bonus of **+X** to the wearer’s **Movement** stat. The value of **X** is specified in the armor’s description. |
| **Self-Sustained (X)** | Contains an independent air supply allowing the wearer to survive without external oxygen for **X hours**. |
| **Under-Armor** | Designed to be worn **beneath other armor types** thanks to its extremely thin and flexible construction. Armor piece with this traint need to be always set as 1st layer. |
| **Shield (X)** | Functions similarly to armor but does **not** cover specific body locations. At the end of each turn, the user declares which direction the shield is facing. All ranged attacks from that direction during the next turn suffer a **−X penalty** to hit the wielder. <br><br> Attackers can attempt to fire **through** the shield, but must overcome its Armor Rating; any remaining damage after subtracting the shield’s AR is applied to the wielder. <br><br>In melee, shields can **parry** incoming attacks, reducing the required success degree by the same margin as the attacker’s skill check. Otherwise, shields impose the same hit penalty against ranged attacks as described above. |
| **Cybernetic Connection** | Requires a **Neural Processor** to function. Without one, the armor’s integrated systems will not operate, rendering it ineffective.|
| **Cover-All** | A large and enveloping armor piece that functions like a **cape or cloak**, concealing what’s worn beneath. When worn, its Armor Rating counts as a **bonus to the underlying 2nd layer armor**, or acts as a **2nd layer** if no other armor is worn beneath it. |
| **Stealthy (X)** | Designed for covert operations and silent movement. Grants **+X** to all **Hide** and **Sneak** skill checks. Additionally, detection checks against the wearer require a **higher degree of success** than the wearer’s result on their Stealth check. |
| **Drone-Hub (X)** | Integrates a control hub allowing direct command over **X drones** simultaneously. Operated via an **onboard LCD interface**, enabling both data acquisition and remote control without relying solely on AI autonomy or voice commands. When paired with a **Drone-Hub Helmet** and **Cybernetic Connection**, the user can control drones via **first-person view** through a HUD or neural interface, freeing their hands from manual operation. |
| **Cumbersome** | Reduces the wearer’s **Movement** by **1 point** and imposes a **−20 penalty** on all **Dodge** and other Dexterity-based skill checks. Penalty stacks with all other Cumbersome armors parts on different body locations. |
| **Advanced Chameleon Paneling** | When used together with a **Cybernetic Connection**, allows the wearer to **dynamically switch** between all available camouflage patterns, instantly applying the appropriate environmental bonus for **Hide** and **Sneak** actions. |
| **Modular** | This armor component can **only be attached** to another armor piece with the **Under-Armor** quality and **cannot be worn separately**. Need to be worn as 2nd layer. |

## Armor Table

| **Table Element**  |                                **Description**                                  |
| :------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   Armor Type   | Describe the broad description of armor defined by the design and description |
|     Name       | The official designation or model name of the armor, used to identify it during gameplay. |
|    Location    | Body location that given armor cover and protect from all incoming damage (if not stated otherwise in additional rules). Should be noted down in appriopriate body location on character sheet under Armor part. |
|  Armor Rating  | Provide player with value of armor protecting player from incoming harm, seprated in three categories: Piercing, Energy, Primitive. Each value protect user from only the damage tpe dealt by weapon used in combat. This armor value is used only against range weapon attacks, while half of the value rounded down is used as defense against all incoming melee weapons attacks. |
| Hardness | All armor in the AOG has a Hardness value, usually listed alongside its Armor Rating. Hardness reflects the overall condition of the armor, showing whether it is in excellent or poor shape: <br> **Starting Hardness:** Calculate by summing the armor’s Armor Rating for the piece. <br> **During Combat:** When the wearer takes damage, compare the damage value to the armor’s Hardness. If damage exceeds Hardness, the armor suffers: Armor Rating for the damage type is reduced by 1. Hardness is reduced by 1 to account for future wear. If Hardness reaches 0, the armor piece is destroyed and cannot be repaired. <br> **Multi-Location Armor:** For armor covering multiple locations, only one location is affected at a time. <br> **Repair:** To repair destroyed or damaged armor consult CRAFTING AND REPAIR page for necessary skill, cost and time required.
| Weight | The armor's mass, measured in pounds; affects encumbrance and mobility. |
| Price | The armor's market value, listed in credits. Prices may vary depending on location, availability, and seller. |
| Qualities | Special traits or unique properties that influence how the armor performs in combat (e.g., Anti-Frag, Cumbersome, Modular).
| Availability | Shows four broad regions of know space: Core World, Colony, Frontier, Space Void which shows how hard, if at all, is to get given piece of equipment with a sucessfull Own Planet/Station skill check |

## Armor Description

### Power Armors

| Name| Reference Picture | Reference |
| :-----: | :-------: | :------: |
| Knight MK.I | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1tvHbfC0/Mk-I.jpg" alt="Knight mk.1" width="5000"> | The Juggernaut is a heavily reinforced exosuit designed for frontline combat in the most hostile environments. Its high-density composite shell, kinetic-reactive sublayer, and shock-absorbing interior make it nearly impervious to conventional firearms, blunt trauma, and concussive forces, with extra reinforcement in the chest and torso. Servo-assisted actuators enhance strength, endurance, and mobility despite the armor’s bulk. <br> <br> Optimized for heavy assault, urban warfare, and prolonged firefights, it can mitigate limited energy-based attacks but is vulnerable to sustained concentrated fire. The Juggernaut allows wearers to carry heavy weapons, strike with increased power, and endure battlefield chaos, making it ideal for shock troops and elite enforcers. Its bulk and energy vulnerabilities require careful tactical use. |
| Knight MK.II | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QtfbvH4k/MK-II.jpg" alt="Knight mk.2" width="5000"> | The Juggernaut MK II is an upgraded, heavier-duty version of the original Juggernaut, designed for frontline assaults, siege operations, and close-quarters combat. Constructed from high-density composite plating with advanced kinetic-reactive layers and energy-diffusing panels, it provides superior protection against both ballistic and energy-based threats. Triple-layered chest and torso armor make the core nearly impervious to high-caliber projectiles and melee attacks. <br> <br> Enhanced servomotors and reinforced actuators grant increased strength, mobility, and carrying capacity, allowing the wearer to wield heavy weapons and perform brute-force maneuvers. While more energy-resistant than its predecessor, prolonged exposure to sustained energy attacks can still degrade defenses. <br> <br> Arcanists contributed to its design by fortifying the molecular structure, but combat performance relies entirely on advanced technology. The MK II excels at breaking enemy lines, surviving heavy fire, and dominating urban or fortified battlefields, offering unmatched protection and raw power for heavy infantry and siege specialists. |

### Standard Armor

| Name| Reference Picture | Reference |
| :-----: | :-------: | :------: |
| Kevlar Armor Set | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/y6MN1YgM/Kevalr-set.jpg" alt="Standard Armor" width="5000"> | A dependable, mass-produced combat armor used by infantry across the Protectorate and frontier colonies alike. Constructed from layered ballistic kevlar composites reinforced with lightweight ceramic plating, it offers solid protection against small-arms fire, shrapnel, and limited energy weapon exposure. The design favors practicality over comfort — easy to maintain, field-repairable, and compatible with most life-support undersuits. Though lacking powered systems or advanced servos, it remains a reliable workhorse of modern warfare, trusted by soldiers who value durability over flash. |
| Standard Helmet | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3NTw3YnW/Standard-Helmet.jpg" alt="Standard Helmet" width="5000"> | A rugged, full-coverage combat helmet designed to complement the Kevlar Armor Set. Made from reinforced kevlar composites with a lightweight ceramic shell, it provides reliable protection against ballistic impact, fragmentation, and low-yield energy glances. The helmet integrates basic comms, short-range encryption, and a modular mount for optics or visor attachments. Simple, durable, and easy to replace in the field, it’s the soldier’s last line of defense — a silent companion through the dust, recoil, and noise of every battlefield. |

### Segmented Armor "Aegis-X"

| Name| Reference Picture | Reference |
| :-----: | :-------: | :------: |
| Plates armor | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2S51Kj1d/aleksandr-menshikov-suit-025-8-10-3.jpg" alt="Segmented Amror" width="5000"> | The Aegis-X is a next-generation modular armor system built for soldiers operating in the most hostile environments — from war-torn colonies to dense urban battlefields. Its interlocking plates provide superior flexibility and protection, adapting to a wide range of threats. <br> <br> Constructed from reinforced nanopolymers and kinetic-dispersive alloys, the armor absorbs and redirects impact from high-caliber rounds and explosive fragments while offering moderate resistance to lasers and plasma. Though highly effective at range, its segmented design leaves minor gaps that make it vulnerable to close-quarters strikes and heavy melee weapons. <br> <br> Lightweight and agile, the Aegis-X moves with the wearer thanks to precision micro-actuators that adjust armor segments in real time. While purely technological in function, Arcanist-engineered refinements during its development strengthened its structure at the molecular level, making it one of the most advanced personal defense systems ever produced.
| Advanced armor "Aegis-XH"| <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8PwLX0z3/cc50b67807ecbf0457d5cef3164411ed.jpg" alt="Advanced Armor" width="5000"> | The Aegis-XH is a fully enclosed combat helmet designed for soldiers operating in toxic, vacuum, or otherwise hostile environments. Built to completely isolate the wearer from the outside atmosphere, it features an internal life-support microcirculation system that allows limited self-sustainment without external aid. <br> <br> Its exterior is lined with micro-cameras feeding a panoramic visual stream directly to the helmet’s internal display, providing the user with a seamless augmented view of the surroundings. The integrated cybernetic uplink allows neural synchronization with onboard systems, optimizing target acquisition, motion prediction, and environmental awareness in real time. <br> <br> Advanced variants come equipped with adaptive optics capable of night vision, image magnification, and dynamic threat highlighting. Combined with encrypted comms and a sealed interface for data sharing, the Aegis-XH represents the pinnacle of protective headgear — a blend of isolation, precision, and battlefield intelligence.

### Mesh Armor

| Name| Reference Picture | Reference |
| :-----: | :-------: | :------: |
| Mesh armor set | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/G26wPQW0/Nowy-obraz-mapy-bitowej.png" alt="Mesh armor" width="5000"> | The Weave-Lite is a cheap, flexible armor garment designed for basic protection in low-intensity combat zones or civilian security work. Its thin fabric blends synthetic fibers with sparse kevlar threading, offering minimal resistance against small-caliber rounds, knife strikes, or flying debris. <br> <br> Favored by freelancers, smugglers, and anyone who can’t afford proper armor, the Weave-Lite’s real advantage lies in its comfort and ease of wear — not its stopping power. It won’t save you from a direct hit, but it might just turn a fatal wound into a bad scar, and for many, that’s protection enough.
|Heavy Mesh Suit | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Px7h3h8Z/Heavy-Mesh-armor.jpg" alt="Heavy Mesh" width="5000"> | An improved version of the original, Heavy mesh suit strengthens the fabric weave with denser kevlar layering and flexible ceramic microplates sewn beneath key impact zones. The result is a lightweight armor that offers modest protection against small-arms fire, shrapnel, and melee strikes while retaining full freedom of movement. <br> <br> Though far from military-grade, Heavy mesh set is a popular choice among security contractors, urban patrol units, and frontier militias who need something tougher than plain clothing but can’t afford heavy armor. Reliable, breathable, and easy to conceal — it’s the middle ground between survival and affordability.
| Mesh Cloak | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/90G9Cx2p/Heavy-Mesh-Cloak.jpg" alt="Mesh Cloak" width="5000"> | A heavy-duty mesh cloak meant as an outer layer for added concealment and basic survivability. Woven from coarse synthetic fibers with sporadic kevlar strands and ceramic flecking, it won’t stop a focused rifle shot but reduces damage from shrapnel and glancing blows while softening blades. Its loose cut drapes over regular clothing or light armor, concealing gear and breaking up silhouettes for stealth or crowd travel. Treated for water and chemical resistance, with a deep hood and reinforced shoulder panel, the Gloommantle also helps a wearer survive harsh weather or contaminated environments for short periods. Favored by scouts, smugglers, and survivalists, it’s cheap, versatile, and designed to be thrown on when discretion or low-level protection is needed. |

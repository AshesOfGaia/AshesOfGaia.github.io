## Armor Qualities

| **Quality** | **Description** |
| :---------: | :-------------: |
| **Anti-Frag** | Doubles the armor rating against weapons with **Fragmentation** trait, such as grenades, explosives, or certain heavy weapons. |
| **Enhanced Strength (X)** | Grants a bonus of **+X** to the wearer’s **Strength** stat. The value of **X** is specified in the armor’s description. |
| **Enhanced Dexterity (X)** | Grants a bonus of **+X** to the wearer’s **Dexterity** stat. The value of **X** is specified in the armor’s description. |
| **Enhanced Movement (X)** | Grants a bonus of **+X** to the wearer’s **Movement** stat. The value of **X** is specified in the armor’s description. |
| **Self-Sustained (X)** | Contains an independent air supply allowing the wearer to survive without external oxygen for **X hours**. |
| **Under-Armor** | Designed to be worn **beneath other armor types** thanks to its extremely thin and flexible construction. Armor piece with this traint need to be always set as 1st layer. |
| **Shield (X)** | Functions similarly to armor but does **not** cover specific body locations. At the end of each turn, the user declares which direction the shield is facing. All ranged attacks from that direction during the next turn suffer a **−X penalty** to hit the wielder. <br><br> Attackers can attempt to fire **through** the shield, but must overcome its Armor Rating; any remaining damage after subtracting the shield’s AR is applied to the wielder. <br><br>In melee, shields can **parry** incoming attacks, reducing the required success degree by the same margin as the attacker’s skill check. Otherwise, shields impose the same hit penalty against ranged attacks as described above. |
| **Cybernetic Connection** | Requires a **Neural Processor** to function. Without one, the armor’s integrated systems will not operate, rendering it ineffective.|
| **Cover-All** | A large and enveloping armor piece that functions like a **cape or cloak**, concealing what’s worn beneath. When worn, its Armor Rating counts as a **bonus to the underlying 2nd layer armor**, or acts as a **2nd layer** if no other armor is worn beneath it. |
| **Stealthy (X)** | Designed for covert operations and silent movement. Grants **+X** to all **Hide** and **Sneak** skill checks. Additionally, detection checks against the wearer require a **higher degree of success** than the wearer’s result on their Stealth check. |
| **Drone-Hub (X)** | Integrates a control hub allowing direct command over **X drones** simultaneously. Operated via an **onboard LCD interface**, enabling both data acquisition and remote control without relying solely on AI autonomy or voice commands. When paired with a **Drone-Hub Helmet** and **Cybernetic Connection**, the user can control drones via **first-person view** through a HUD or neural interface, freeing their hands from manual operation. |
| **Cumbersome** | Reduces the wearer’s **Movement** by **1 point** and imposes a **−20 penalty** on all **Dodge** and other Dexterity-based skill checks. Penalty stacks with all other Cumbersome armors parts on different body locations. |
| **Advanced Chameleon Paneling** | When used together with a **Cybernetic Connection**, allows the wearer to **dynamically switch** between all available camouflage patterns, instantly applying the appropriate environmental bonus for **Hide** and **Sneak** actions. |
| **Modular** | This armor component can **only be attached** to another armor piece with the **Under-Armor** quality and **cannot be worn separately**. Need to be worn as 2nd layer. |

## Armor Table

| **Table Element**  |                                **Description**                                  |
| :------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   Armor Type   | Describe the broad description of armor defined by the design and description |
|     Name       | The official designation or model name of the armor, used to identify it during gameplay. |
|    Location    | Body location that given armor cover and protect from all incoming damage (if not stated otherwise in additional rules). Should be noted down in appriopriate body location on character sheet under Armor part. |
|  Armor Rating  | Provide player with value of armor protecting player from incoming harm, seprated in three categories: Piercing, Energy, Primitive. Each value protect user from only the damage tpe dealt by weapon used in combat. This armor value is used only against range weapon attacks, while half of the value rounded down is used as defense against all incoming melee weapons attacks. |
| Hardness | All armor in the AOG has a Hardness value, usually listed alongside its Armor Rating. Hardness reflects the overall condition of the armor, showing whether it is in excellent or poor shape: <br> **Starting Hardness:** Calculate by summing the armor’s Armor Rating for the piece. <br> **During Combat:** When the wearer takes damage, compare the damage value to the armor’s Hardness. If damage exceeds Hardness, the armor suffers: Armor Rating for the damage type is reduced by 1. Hardness is reduced by 1 to account for future wear. If Hardness reaches 0, the armor piece is destroyed and cannot be repaired. <br> **Multi-Location Armor:** For armor covering multiple locations, only one location is affected at a time. <br> **Repair:** To repair destroyed or damaged armor consult CRAFTING AND REPAIR page for necessary skill, cost and time required.
| Weight | The armor's mass, measured in pounds; affects encumbrance and mobility. |
| Price | The armor's market value, listed in credits. Prices may vary depending on location, availability, and seller. |
| Qualities | Special traits or unique properties that influence how the armor performs in combat (e.g., Anti-Frag, Cumbersome, Modular).
| Availability | Shows four broad regions of know space: Core World, Colony, Frontier, Space Void which shows how hard, if at all, is to get given piece of equipment with a sucessfull Own Planet/Station skill check |

## Armor Description

### Power Armors

| Name| Reference Picture | Reference |
| :-----: | :-------: | :------: |
| Knight MK.I | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1tvHbfC0/Mk-I.jpg" alt="Knight mk.1" width="5000"> | **"Juggernaut" Advanced Powered Armor** <br> The Juggernaut is the pinnacle of modern powered armor technology, a heavily reinforced exosuit designed for direct combat in the most hostile battlefields across the galaxy. Unlike conventional body armor, it enhances the wearer’s physical capabilities while offering an unprecedented level of protection. Built for shock troopers, mechanized infantry, and elite enforcers, this armor turns its user into a walking fortress, capable of withstanding immense punishment while delivering overwhelming force. <br> **Structure and Protection** <br> The Juggernaut's outer shell is composed of high-density composite plating, reinforced with a kinetic-reactive sublayer that disperses impact force, making it nearly impervious to standard firearms and blunt-force trauma. The inner framework integrates shock-absorbing materials, reducing concussive damage and minimizing internal injuries. Servomotors and reinforced actuators support movement, compensating for the armor’s bulk while granting the wearer increased strength and endurance. Unlike traditional armor, the Juggernaut prioritizes maximum durability in critical areas, such as the chest and torso, where additional plating and multi-layered reinforcement provide near-impenetrable defense. The limbs and helmet, while still heavily armored, maintain a degree of flexibility to ensure battlefield effectiveness. <br> **Combat Capabilities** <br> This exosuit excels in prolonged firefights, urban warfare, and heavy assault operations. While optimized to withstand kinetic and melee-based attacks, it also includes limited energy dispersion systems, which help mitigate damage from directed energy weapons like lasers or plasma. However, sustained or concentrated energy fire can overwhelm its defenses, particularly in less reinforced areas. Thanks to its servo-assisted exoskeleton, the Juggernaut grants its wearer enhanced physical capabilities, including increased striking power, carrying capacity, and stability when firing heavy weaponry. Although bulkier than standard combat armor, its internal power systems compensate for the weight, allowing for surprisingly fluid movement despite its formidable mass. <br>**Tactical Role**<br> The Juggernaut is the ultimate frontline armor, designed for those who refuse to back down from overwhelming odds. It allows its wearer to push forward through gunfire, survive close-quarters engagements against melee combatants, and endure battlefield chaos that would cripple lesser armor systems. However, its increased bulk and vulnerability to sustained energy attacks require strategic deployment and proper support. |
| Knight MK.II | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QtfbvH4k/MK-II.jpg" alt="Knight mk.2" width="5000"> | **"Juggernaut MK II"  Advanced Powered Armor** <br> The Juggernaut MK II is a heavily upgraded version of the original Juggernaut armor, designed for direct combat in the most dangerous battlefields. Stronger, tougher, and more advanced, it enhances the wearer’s physical capabilities while offering superior protection against both kinetic and energy-based threats. Built for shock troopers, heavy infantry, and siege specialists, this armor turns its user into an unstoppable force, capable of withstanding devastating attacks while delivering overwhelming power. <br> **Structure and Protection** <br> The Juggernaut MK II is constructed from high-density composite plating, reinforced with advanced kinetic-reactive layers that absorb and disperse impact. The chest and torso are further protected by triple-layered armor, making them nearly immune to high-caliber projectiles and melee strikes. The armor now includes energy-diffusing panels, offering better protection against lasers and plasma, especially around the core. While still massive, improved servomotors and reinforced actuators compensate for the added weight, providing increased strength and mobility. <br> **Combat Capabilities** <br> The Juggernaut MK II excels in frontline combat, siege operations, and close-quarters engagements. Its power-assisted exoskeleton grants the user enhanced physical strength, allowing them to carry heavy weapons and perform brute-force maneuvers with ease. <br> **Upgrades include:** <br> Improved Energy Resistance – Better protection against sustained laser and plasma fire. <br> Increased Strength – Stronger actuators allow the wearer to lift heavier loads and strike with greater force. <br> Enhanced Armor Coverage – Additional plating reduces vulnerabilities on the limbs and helmet without sacrificing flexibility. <br> While more resistant to energy attacks than its predecessor, prolonged exposure to high-energy weapons can still weaken its defenses over time. <br> **Arcanist Influence in Design** <br> As with the original, Arcanists were involved in the construction process, using their abilities to strengthen the armor’s molecular structure. This allows the MK II to maintain its durability despite its increased weight and complexity. However, the armor remains a purely technological system during combat, relying on advanced engineering rather than magical enhancements. <br> **Tactical Role** <br> The Juggernaut MK II is designed to dominate the battlefield. It allows its wearer to push through enemy lines, endure heavy fire, and break through fortified positions. While still bulky, its increased power output ensures smooth mobility and operational efficiency. Ideal for frontline assaults, urban warfare, and heavy siege, the MK II is the ultimate tool for those who need unmatched protection and raw power in the heart of battle. |

### Standard Armor

| Kevlar Armor Set | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/y6MN1YgM/Kevalr-set.jpg" alt="Knight mk.2" width="5000"> | A dependable, mass-produced combat armor used by infantry across the Protectorate and frontier colonies alike. Constructed from layered ballistic kevlar composites reinforced with lightweight ceramic plating, it offers solid protection against small-arms fire, shrapnel, and limited energy weapon exposure. The design favors practicality over comfort — easy to maintain, field-repairable, and compatible with most life-support undersuits. Though lacking powered systems or advanced servos, it remains a reliable workhorse of modern warfare, trusted by soldiers who value durability over flash. |
| Standard Helmet | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3NTw3YnW/Standard-Helmet.jpg" alt="Knight mk.2" width="5000"> | A rugged, full-coverage combat helmet designed to complement the Kevlar Armor Set. Made from reinforced kevlar composites with a lightweight ceramic shell, it provides reliable protection against ballistic impact, fragmentation, and low-yield energy glances. The helmet integrates basic comms, short-range encryption, and a modular mount for optics or visor attachments. Simple, durable, and easy to replace in the field, it’s the soldier’s last line of defense — a silent companion through the dust, recoil, and noise of every battlefield. |

| Mesh armor set | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/G26wPQW0/Nowy-obraz-mapy-bitowej.png" alt="Knight mk.2" width="5000"> | The Weave-Lite is a cheap, flexible armor garment designed for basic protection in low-intensity combat zones or civilian security work. Its thin fabric blends synthetic fibers with sparse kevlar threading, offering minimal resistance against small-caliber rounds, knife strikes, or flying debris. <br> <br> Favored by freelancers, smugglers, and anyone who can’t afford proper armor, the Weave-Lite’s real advantage lies in its comfort and ease of wear — not its stopping power. It won’t save you from a direct hit, but it might just turn a fatal wound into a bad scar, and for many, that’s protection enough.
|Heavy Mesh Suit | <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Px7h3h8Z/Heavy-Mesh-armor.jpg" alt="Knight mk.2" width="5000"> | An improved version of the original, Heavy mesh suit strengthens the fabric weave with denser kevlar layering and flexible ceramic microplates sewn beneath key impact zones. The result is a lightweight armor that offers modest protection against small-arms fire, shrapnel, and melee strikes while retaining full freedom of movement. <br> <br> Though far from military-grade, Heavy mesh set is a popular choice among security contractors, urban patrol units, and frontier militias who need something tougher than plain clothing but can’t afford heavy armor. Reliable, breathable, and easy to conceal — it’s the middle ground between survival and affordability.

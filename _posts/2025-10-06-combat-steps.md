## Step 1 - Attack In Turn
Which consecutive attack in this turn is it?

|  |  |
|-------------:|:-----------|
| 1<sup>st</sup> | +0 TO ATTACK ROLL |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> | -20 TO ATTACK ROLL |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> | -40 TO ATTACK ROLL |

## Step 2 - Range Modifiers

Choose the first range that applies to the distance to your target.

|  |  |  |
|-------------:|:-----------|:------------:|
| STANDARD RANGE | UP TO RANGE STATED IN WEAPON TABLE | 0 TO ATTACK ROLL |
| LONG RANGE | UP TO DOUBLE THE STANDARD RANGE ON A WEAPON | -30 TO ATTACK ROLL |
| EXTREME RANGE | UP TO TRIPLE THE STANDARD RANGE ON A WEAPON | -60 TO ATTACK ROLL |

## Step 3 - Cover Modifiers

Does your enemy hide behind a cover?

|  |  |  |
|-------------:|:-----------|:------------:|
| LIGHT COVER | EXAMPLE: STEEL BARRELS, CRATES, SHIELD'S | -15 TO ATTACK ROLL |
| MEDIUM COVER | EXAMPLE: CONCRETE WALL, PEAK FROM WINDOW, PEAKING FROM TRENCH | -30 TO ATTACK ROLL |
| FULL COVER | YOU CANNOT MAKE RANGED ATTACK CHECKS AGAINST TARGET THAT ARE COVERED BY FULL COVER. EXAMPLE: HIDING BEHIND STEEL CONTAINER, KNEELING IN TRENCH. EVEN IF TARGET IS IN FULL COVER, YOU STILL MAY DECIDE TO SHOOT HIM THROUGH THE COVER. IN THAT CASE, CONSULT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST | -∞ TO ATTACK ROLL |

## Step 4 - Environmental Modifiers

      <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"> -30 TO ATTACK ROLLS </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Step 5 - Miscellaneous Modifiers

|  |  |  |
|-------------:|:-----------|:------------:|
| SHOOTING INTO MELEE COMBAT | WHENEVER YOU MAKE RANGED ATTACK AGAINST A TARGET WHO IS ENGAGED IN MELEE COMBAT, AND DECIDE NOT BE EXTRA CAREFULL, YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO HIT YOUR FRIEND INSTEAD. NO MATTER IF YOU SUCCESSED ON THE ATTACK OR MISS, YOU NEED TO REVERSE THE NUMBER ROLLED ON DICES AND CHECK IF THE NEW NUMBER FIT THE RANGE 1-35. IF SO, YOU HIT YOUR ALLY INSTEAD. | |
| CLOSE RANGE | IF YOU ARE STANDING NEXT TO A TARGET (LESS OR EQUAL TO 2 METERS) AND TRY TO MAKE A RANGE ATTACK WITH A WEAPON USING LONG ARMS OR HEAVY ARMS SKILL, THEN YOU SUFFER A PENALTY OF -30 WHEN MAKING RANGE ATTACK WITH THAT WEAPON. | -30 TO ATTACK ROLL
| MOVING TARGET | WHENEVER YOU TRY TO MAKE AN RANGE ATTACK AGAINST A TARGET THAT IS RUNNING OR CHARGING IN HIS TURN, YOU SUFFER A -20 PENALTY TO THE SKILL CHECK YOU MAKE TO HIT THE TARGET. | - 20 TO ATTACK ROLL |
| MELEE WEAPON RANGE DISADVANTAGE | WHENEVER TWO CHARACTER ENTER A MELEE COMBAT, ITS NECESSARY TO ASSESS THE RANGE BETWEEN THEM. IF NOT STATED OTHERWISE BEFORE COMBAT, COMBAT BEGINS AT RANGE OF THE LONGER WEAPON.  CHARACTER WITH LONGER WEAPON CAN FREELY ATTACK CHARACTER WITH SHORTER WEAPON, WHILE CHARACTER WITH SHORTER WEAPON SUFFER A PENALTY OF -30 TO ALL ATTACKS AND DEFENSE CHECK. CHARACTER WITH SHORTER WEAPON CAN DECIDE TO SPEND ONE ACTION AND SHORTEN THE DISTANCE TO THE CHARACTER WITH LONGER WEAPON. IN THAT CASE, BOTH CHARACTER MAKE A MELEE WEAPON CHECK AND COMPARE THE RESULTS. HIGHER DEGREE OF SUCCESS MEANS THAT A SHORTER WEAPON WIELDER CLOSE DISTANCE AND NOW, THE CHARACTER WITH LONGER WEAPON SUFFER PENALTY OF -30 TO ALL ATTACKS AND DEFENSE CHECKS. DEFENDER, LONGER WEAPON, WINS THE DRAWS.  | - 30 TO ATTACK ROLL (see descr.)
| SHIELD MODIFIER (**X**) | ENEMY WIELDING SHIELD IMPOSE PENALTY TO HIT HIM EQUAL DO NUMBER IN PLACE OF X, FROM RANGE OF -10 TO -40 | -**X** TO ATTACK ROLL |

## Ad. 1 - Random Direction Table

<div class="random-dir-table" markdown="1">

<table>
  <thead>
    <th colspan="3"></th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3"> FIRST ROLL 1D100 TO CHECK IN WHICH DIRECTION GIVEN OBJECT/GRENADE/MISSILE GONNA VENTURE AND THEN MAKE ROLL 2D10 TO CHECK HOW FAR AWAY FROM CENTER IT FALL IN METERS </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> 01 - 12 </td>
      <td> 13 - 24 </td>
      <td> 25 - 36 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> 85 - 96 </td>
      <td style="font-size: 150%;"> <strong> <b> X </b> </strong> </td>
      <td> 37 - 48 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> 73 - 84 </td>
      <td> 61 - 72 </td>
      <td> 49 - 60 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3"> ON 97 - 100 YOU FAILED EXTRA HARD IN HITTING TARGET. CHECK DIRECTION AGAIN, UNTIL YOU GET A PROPER ONE, AND ROLL 4D10 TO CHECK HOW FAR AWAY IN METERS IT FALL </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Ad. 2 - Hit Locations

If you have not declared a '[Called Shot/Attack](/posts/action-tables#normal-actions)' when attack, then reverse the result on the dice and consult the following image.

<div class="random-hit">

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/76j5cP3X/AOG-Hit-Locs.png" alt="Hit Locations Chart: 01-08 Head, 09-16 Right Arm, 17-24 Left Arm, 25-50 Chest, 51-75 Stomach, 76-87 Right Leg, 88-100 Left Leg">

</div>

## Ad. 3 - Combat Example

### Ranged Combat

Rate of fire (ROF) shows if the weapon is capable of making semi and auto modes of fire on top of standard single attack, but do not grant any additional modifier when shooting. Instead, rate of fire shows how many attacks can be done in a turn. Single mode makes one attack in a turn, semi auto mode allows two attacks in a turn, and a full auto mode allows for 3 attacks in a turn. Modifiers for making more than one attack in a turn stay the same, showing how hard it is to keep the gun under control when firing with higher ROF than a single shot.

> The Rate of Fire (ROF) determines how many attacks a weapon can make per turn. It does not provide any additional modifiers when shooting.

## **ASHES OF GAIA**

### **INTRO**

Welcome to the year of 3437 - according to the Khargan calendar at least - and surprise, surprise, humanity not only did survive internal global conflicts and unrest, but also thrived… Most of the time. 

Humans, in their ever growing masses, spread over stars, met no one and according to the old saying “Its free real estate” decided to move in. And move in they did.

For over four centuries, humanity has been no longer limited to only one green-blue planet in a singular solar system. Humanity had left their home planet Gaia - a planet no longer called home by all humans - and colonized over twenty new worlds spread around once distant stars. Some of them turn out to be hospitable enough to spawn populations of billions within a few generations. 

People were always multiplying, but theoretically an unlimited amount of space and land to inhabit, turned on certain basic instincts that modern society extinguished through the earliest centuries. And so humanity rapidly multiplied - shocking, right?

And then there are all those other planets that humanity encounters on their way. The less pleasant ones. Sometimes radioactive, sometimes just boring. Hundreds of colonies, from mining holes to city-sized orbitals. Each one of them becomes a part in a larger puzzle - some provide raw materials, others prey on them in the name of development, security, or pure greed.

None of this would be possible without three things: Firstly, technology that defied the limits put on the human body and allowed possibilities not imaginable earlier. Secondly, the magic through which the breakthrough opened the way to other star systems, allow more rapid adjustment of new planets and create a whole new demand for magic users. Thirdly, a little bit of faith, which accompanied humanity through all that time and by some twist of fate, allowed all of this to happen through an otherworldly impact on certain important peoples.

Welcome to the year 3437. Humanity has grown, and with it - its mistakes, ambitions, and monsters.

Most of them still look like us.

### **THREE MAIN THEMES**

The whole setting is built around three main themes that together create a multi-layer and complex world, both ready to explore and to be built on by both players, game-masters and so on. 

**Technology, Magic and Religion.**

First of all, let's start with **technology**, as it's gonna be the main theme for the bigger part of the game experience for the players. It's gonna cover weapons, armors and everyday items that characters might need. Transport, food, cybernetic and so on are also part of this theme, as it will be necessary to use it to achieve anything in that world.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/x8hg3nQ1/ryan-dening-nf-scirocco-equipmentroom-01.jpg" alt="TECH PIC 1">

When it comes to technology, there are three sub-type genres from which the world takes inspiration when dealing with technology. Main one is, as it will be clearly visible in the further descriptions, hard sci-fi, followed by cyberpunk and finally space drama. Bear with me as I explain more below. 

Hard sci-fi aspect of the setting shows itself in a way how certain laws of physics, chemistry and so on, and so on, are still intact and the problem of dealing with them was walked around by both the space drama aspect and magic existing in the setting. For that reason we have both space combat focused on long range encounters with usage of torpedoes as main weapon, no gravitation on space ships without thrust of the engine that create artificial force of gravitation and the fact that it's nearly impossible to break the laws of relativity in space travel, while at the same time aspects of both cyberpunk, space drama and magic (explained later) help us walk around those issues to create a big narrative setting of many star systems and planets that player and game masters can use in their games. Thanks to that that, focus of the game can be put as much on day to day life on realistic spaceship, as much as interstellar travels and big jobs requiring traveling from planet to planet, and so on

Cyberpunk aspect of technology comes into play when it comes to both accessibility and ease of use of technology that even though highly advanced, is still in the reach of most people around. Cybernetic arm is lowered in price and accessibility to smartphones of our current world. You still don't know exactly how it works, arm or iphone, but you can theoretically buy both in the same shop, plus cost of installation in the case of the arm. Point is, it's there, it's gonna help you in everyday life and space journeys too, but you need to have cash to access all of this. 

Space drama part comes into play when you really start thinking about how certain aspects of the setting might need a bit of mental stretching when it comes to rules ruling the setting. Technology, magic and religion coexisting in one setting make it a perfect place for stories that would focus more on the character just going through their own fictional life  set in this universe, that just a deep dive into how the fuck we get a laser rifle, but cant get a stable internet connection while driving in a god dammed capital of this interstellar empire. Just don't think too much and enjoy the game, and if needed, change stuff up to your needs. 

---

**Magic** - or as it's called in setting, Arcana - makes up a big, important aspect of the game that makes certain things in-game possible, that would otherwise be impossible if we simply followed basic understanding of how for example a space travel outside of the solar system would work. 

Warp-speed, Hyperspace, going through a literal different dimension with demons and so on, are just different examples on how certain holes in the setting need to be filled for the setting to actually be dealing with interstellar problems. We have a teleportation with the use of magic users over great distances of space void, that deliver instant and quite precise change of location of the ship between star systems. And as said earlier, when dealing with such plot filling concepts, there are also opportunities to enrich the setting itself. That's when other uses of magic come into play, but let's not get ahead of ourselves for now. 

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bJjRJ3TL/464cd48fd2148481382bd6c7cde6b824.jpg" alt="TECH PIC 1">

Magic in our setting is science based, but also science breaking. Magic users, from now on called Arcanists, are rare, powerful, influential and dangerous (to both others and to themselves) They are born with access to magic, invisible and impossible to verify scientifically raw power, that when used by someone who understand the rules of science ruling our reality, can bend them to their will, even if briefly. 

That's just the basic overview of magic in the system, but it's no less one of the foundation stones of the setting and gameplay. Otherwise known as “The Source” our setting magic is a hard magic system, with almost all the time predictable outcomes of magic used, way to learn it and its own risks. More on in-game magic later in the rulebook.

---

And so we come to the last main theme of the setting, which is Religion. 

**Religion** shapes worlds view and cultures, as it is the same in our setting. There is no one true god, no matter what some of the npc might say, because there are whole pantheons of them and all of them are just ready to be worshipped by humans living in the setting.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BvvK3C6P/8f16c420570cde537307a4e656ba3046.jpg" alt="TECH PIC 1">

Now, while having all the information stated above, lets move to the actual meaning of what it is to have religion, faith and gods in this setting. Technology and magic come to play in the life of everyday people at all times, whenever they notice it or not, and it's no different when it comes to religion. Here are some facts worth to know:

Gods are real, and there is no discussion. They are cold and distant to the most, beside those deeply dedicated believers. They don't change the laws of the universe as magic tends to do, but their faithfull experience gods attention and touch in the form of blessings. To not believe in a god that sends signs all around is to be either dumb or vain. Either way, gods don't care. Their attention falls on those most faithfull, while rest may do by themselves for as much as god's care and that's the truth of the universe we set our game in. 

They say “You pull a trigger, but gods carry the bullets” is more true for some people than others.

### SUMMARY

The Co-existence of those three themes make up the setting of Ashes of Gaia that we are gonna explore more deeply in the rulebook below. We're gonna start with the description of basic knowledge available to any person living in the setting, like most recent history, space travel, colonization of distant planets and finally, current setting with all political nuances, challenges that players will encounter and opportunities.

## HISTORY IN SHORT

Most of the history from pre-modern times is quite unimportant, as all the struggle that lead to creation of modern times nations and cultures was important only in the one crucial aspect: **First fall of humanity**. Never less, let's sum up what happened in ages before First Fall.

Life on Gaia developed in the same way as in our world, where through ages and millennia civilizations and cultures rose from tribe, through kingdoms and petty states, to nations that finally started deciding about the direction of not only their own planet of origin, but other planets of their solar system too. But to be fair, it was as decentralized and messy as in real life, which led to the First Fall in the long run. Governments of democratic, totalitarian and any in between countries, together with greedy corporations and billionaires who wished to become trillionaires, carved the home solar system into their own pieces of jurisdiction - for that period of time, read in **AOG history** later in the rulebook. 

For now, let's go back to more recent history that your character at the moment of starting the game might actually remember, even if as though the mist of childhood memories. 

With the new age of space colonization that turned into a rush for territory and resources, all twelve planets of the solar system were fastly colonized, mined and used by humanity who with the help of Arcanist achieved travel inside of the system with incredible speed and efficiency. Still, even with all that advancing technology and constant improvement, humanity was unable to leave their **native star system**. 

The struggle was growing with more and more limited useful space falling into influence of strong Gaian nations, and creation of new nations spread around more and more independent colonies in the solar system. All that was leading to total war that would sooner or later end in total annihilation of all that humanity achieved.

Fortunately for humanity, **Alexand Hopsten** happened, and with him a new chapter for the spread of humanity and endless opportunities that were able to delay the inevitable disintegration of humanity’s barely holding itself together.

**Nyxalis, Eryndor, Pelagora, Xytherra, Kaelith, Nemoris, Varynth, Calystris, Golrara, Nitov, Dinerth, Drion, Ocarro, Ramone, Nuthea, Ouria, Gankulara, Sewei, Vitinus, Doaturn** were planets discovered in stated order, with climate and conditions sufferable enough for humanity to throw themselves at the opportunity to call new planet their home. With new planets and colonies, new nations came to existence and with them new technologies, materials and political agendas. 

**The old world** became a center hub of humanity that started being decentralized more and more with the flow of time. Industry demand for terraforming technologies and production power became a main source of weakening influence of Gaian national governments over distant stars. 

**Corporations** started growing in power and living conditions started to seriously decline, while wealth differences between rich and poor became extreme to the point where more and more radical agendas started to spread both around the poor, wealthy and those who started to fall into despair with the slow decline of humanity.

**Piracy** on the outer borders of colonized space became a nightmare, while more and more growing terrorism groups became the main threat to not only stability of developing colonies, but also to the chain of supplies between the core world and surrounding mines and space stations. Those were the veins of humanity on which millions of lives were dependable with everyday life and chance for potential future. Even greater became the threat of common people **rising against** their alleged oppressors and followers of gods whose influence were diminishing until now, but started to grow back and become more and more extreme in their view of the corrupted world.

All that finally came to the boiling point when a group of terrorists fighting for **independence of Xythera** and some minor mining colonies around it, dropped a **small sized asteroid** straight into one of the biggest cities on Gaia. **The death toll** was catastrophic, the climate crisis was horrendous and the political situation led to outright **war** between wronged nations and those who were far enough from Gaia to start declaring their own **independence** from the fossilized mother-world of humanity.

Twenty five million people vanished instantly when the asteroid hit the land, many more hundreds of millions died out because of the consequences of the dust fallout, and famine that followed with nuclear winter afterward. Air became semi breathable, food scarce and suddenly main import in all nations of Gaia became food, medical equipment and medicine, instead of natural resources that once burned in the fire of now dying Gaian industries. 

---

At this time of unimaginable crisis, many of the Gaian governments fell into disarray or outright fell apart as temporary government bodies took control of the least stable nations. The outright threat of nuclear warfare became a reality while unrest, stress and panic became the main source of information flowing to the greater galaxy from the birthplace of humanity.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d15PjkDp/AAAAAA.png" alt="TECH PIC 1">

Then, suddenly and abruptly in a manner too much organized to be a simple burst of cooperation, the threat of war on Gaia was vanquished. It wasn’t a peaceful resolution though. 

A secret military alliance was struck between commanders of both fleets and armies. Martial law was introduced, protests dealt with by force and all possible effort put into first of all, setting Gaia back into fit form. 

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DyZsgtps/c8f01d0b4c63e68ccbf391f053b8fd1c.jpg" alt="TECH PIC 1">

Arcanist were put to work with their reality altering powers, multi billion contracts signed between governments and corporations that from now on would focus on both cleaning up the atmosphere of Gaia, while at the same time restructuring food production with focus on feeding a massive, starting population.  

It wasn’t a fast process and for sure it wasn't peaceful, but with all that sacrifice one main target was achieved. Stability.

The unified government, from now on called the Central Council (CC in short), composed of military commanders and corporate representatives authorized itself to exercise control over Gaia and their territories, still loyal to them. After the purge of dissidents, terrorists and rebels, unification of the solar system started with securing both asteroid belts rich in resources and first colonies spread around the native system, with the population craving both stability and relief from a violent period of time.

With the first successes of unification spread around population bringing in fresh recruits, and acquired again resources to fuel reawaked Gaian economy anew, then a time for a strike outside of the home system came and CC struck hard. 

WSU which stands for War of Systems Unification began and is lasting until now on more than one front at the same time. Massive armies mustered by CC, filled with recruits of both young and old age from around solar system, and armed by Gaian industry boiling to thrive again began an unstoppable wave of reminding all human colonized planets that they all came from one single place, and that place demand that years of ignorance and rebellion will need to be repaid with interest.   And so did fleets start seizing void space and ships belonging to yesteryear Gaian colonies and now semi independent planets that with every decade passing yet again found themselves under a lot more centralised rule. Some join Gaia willingly, others not, but on that subject you can read later in this introduction.

Of course such reunification doctrine wasn’t perfect, but it was deemed necessary by CC as leaving any of the zones without a proper enough presence of the Gaian fleet would leave newly forming political entity vulnerable to potential attacks and distractions. With more and more sectors and core planets joining willingly back into Gaian command under the newly forming Protectorate of Core Systems, the closer was the known galaxy to the state of peace. Even if forced down the galaxy throat with a gun put to the temple.

At current time there are still few active combat zones that are still hot and burning, especially in systems of two Core worlds still resisting unification. Rest of the war is taking place either in minor colonies and stations that moved to guerilla warfare against PCS forces, or is pointed at pirates and rebels that didn't lay down their weapons with the fall of their home planets.

War of System Unification is slowly moving to an end, but since the war became a constant part of the PCS economy and style of life for many, there are those who start to doubt the reality of non-war existence of PCS and CC. As long as war continues, humankind has a reason to be united and the possibility of falling into chaos again, make many feel uneasy.

## SPACE TRAVEL

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jdCQ6tKj/aleksandre-lortkipanidze-fr03-01.jpg" alt="TECH PIC 1">

Looking at the rapid development of humankind spread over the nearby star systems and colonization of their planet, no matter the quality of said planet, it is easy to notice a bit of discrepancy between speed of colonization and technological advancement.

On one side humanity at the current time, 3437 years of Known Age, colonized over twenty planets with climate similar to their home planet but not exactly perfect for human life. Nyxalis, Eryndor, Pelagora, Xytherra, Kaelith, Nemoris, Varynth, Calystris, Golrara, Nitov, Dinerth, Drion, Ocarro, Ramone, Nuthea, Ouria, Gankulara, Sewei, Vitinus, Doaturn and many more, are planets so close to what humankind dreamt of when they venture into start for the first time, and yet their extensive colonization was paid for with enormous effort and sacrifice of human life. 

For all those twenty planets nearly perfect for human conquest, there are 100 of those that humanity visited and found only barren rocks that would take centuries to slowly terraform, or would require extreme desperation to call it a home. And yet, those planets still fall prey to human colonization instinct that constantly pushes them into the unknown.

But none of that would be possible without the possibility to leave their home solar system and discover those planets in the first place. Such a possibility was presented to mankind by the young and brilliant Arcanist obsessed with stars, going by the name of Alexand Hopsten.  Thanks to his born talent, extensive study and scientific research, he accomplished a first interstellar jump to the closest star system that humanity observed with big hopes for decades.

That ground-shaking breakthrough in both magical and scientific fields became a starting point for moving fast forward investment into space travel, colonization and ecosystem adaptation technologies. Gigantic corporations, backed by their national governments and popular interest around those country citizens, strike a sudden, chaotic and in many cases failed interstellar expansion of mankind's living space. But on that subject we are gonna say more in laters chapters.

---

Let's start with explaining a few important terms and ideas standing behind mankind as a space faring race:

Navigators - Is a common term used by mankind to describe an Arcanist who is specialised in interstellar guidance of the ship through stars. Those magic users are persons of great renown, very generously compensated for their work and with a sure chance for very early retirement in luxury, if of course they don’t die in the process. Use of magic is always an undertaking heavy on the body of the Arcanist, and the process of translocation of a giant mass of the ship between astronomical distances is no small task lay on the arms of a simple human. Seizures, strokes and “sudden death syndrome” is just a thing that every “navigator” accepts as a part of their flashy career. 

Depending on their experience and overall skills, those arcanists might either operate grand "ARCS” ships in cooperation with other less skilled adepts, or personally operate all manner of private, military or corporate ships of all sizes and tonnage.

Only a very small percentage of even the most promising young Arcanists are capable of becoming a Navigator. Right after Academy on Gaia, in fashion similar to those not destined for navigators role, they are given under care, training and guidance of experienced Navigators who make sure that their pupils can take their position in the future.

“ARCS” - This name does not correspond to the official names given those ships that those words describe but rather the idea standing behind those ships. Massive skeletal ships of oval design, hundreds or thousands of crew members, and at least six navigators are the bare ideas hidden behind common understanding of what those space behemoths truly are. 

Truth is a lot simpler when you understand that those ships, even though a mobile space station is a more fitting term, are simply space faring cargo containers of old. Their job is to haul both materials, products and humans over great distances of space, and traveling from one orbital lift or space station to another in the next star system. Those ships carrying space are theoretically cheap, easily accessible and allow massive in scale transport of colonists, tourists and travelers between Core Planets. Access and movement of those ships as well as security is a matter of strict protectorate regulations. 

Even though rebel forces have considerably more limited access to both navigators and their own version of ARCS, they still operate a number of those ships that keep their decentralized sphere of influence together and allow continuous resistance against Protectorate moloch. 

Smaller but more greater in number ships of that type belong to many mega-corpo responsible for industrial and by that economical growth of mankind. Nonetheless, even corporations are not outside of the sharp eyes of the Central government and those keys for mankind survival ships are under constant observation.

Jumpers - A term used to describe ships of both military, corporate and private grade, capable of interstellar travel with the use of single or a duo of navigators. The Protectorate of Core Systems (PCS) and The Unified Front of Systems Independence (UFSI) are the only big geopolitical powers capable of both usage and maintenance of vast fleets operating in dozens of systems at once. 

On the more civilian level, many of the big corporations hire at least a dozen Arcanist at once, that in turn operate their interstellar freighters and vast supply routes. Smaller or more local corporations in turn use their bigger rivals' services at the cost of partial dependency. Such practice, out of practicality, is no different in neither PCS nor UFSI.

In private hands, both navigators and ships capable of interstellar jumps, are in service to only the most wealthy and influential. That means either aristocracy of old with tons of generational wealth, or those who with time grow such fortune. In the case of the latter, usually their fortune comes from corporations or government interests as it was written earlier.

Navigation beacons - Those planetary mega-structures are not only one of the most important pieces of both planetary and interstellar achievements, but also a crucial part of safe space travels between all colonised planets. Usually in a shape of a single tower dominating over surrounding terrain those imbued with arcane powers antennas are a source of constant information for navigators about quite precise localisation of core worlds based on which navigators can safely translocate ships towards chosen destination. It does negate the risk of jumps put on Navigator's body, but minimize jumps inaccuracy and navigation through the void of space hardship.

Those structures present not only extreme military importance objects but also belong to a long list of HPO - High Priority Objects for security organised by local colony government administration.

Additionally, terrain around those beacons is in most cases a playground for protectorate ground military forces that understand the importance of the unbroken chain of logistics that comes with security and maintenance of those complex arcane structures.

---

Having said all those most important aspects of space travel, let's move to a few important details that were left out in previous descriptions. 

Hard parts of interstellar travel do not lay in time necessary for getting from one point to another, but rather in the rarity of sorcerers capable of piloting those ships with precision and safety. 

Interstellar translocation is instant and to a point similar in idea to teleportation, which basically diminish the possible problems with passage of time. Thanks to that an organised and structured communication between colonies can be established and no human colonised world is left out of the information loop, beside slight delays of course necessary for a ship getting from one colony to another.

Space travel inside of a star system is a completely different beast. Lack of gravitation is to a point negated by speed of space travel that creates an artificial gravitational force from a perspective of people traveling on those ships, but at the same time strongly limits the maximum speed of travel between planets and stations in a star system. 

This problem was, to a degree, walk around by introduction of chemical substance obtained, distilled and purified on planet Xytherra, called High Gravitational Force Compensator - H.G.F.C in short, which get commonly called “High” as effects of its burning by the body exposed to it during acceleration through void of space, leave user in state similar to withdrawal from light drugs.

Worth to mention, that even though “High” mitigates negative effects of high acceleration speed on the human body to the point of making sure that the human body survives, it doesn't make the human body any more resistant to possible damage of such acceleration. For that reason alone all high speed travel in-system is done in sitting or even lying position straight forward toward  the direction of travel.

Whenever a necessity for a high speed arises, then there are three other methods that are implemented on ships of high end of prices. First and least invasive is of course the traveling in a lying position, which helps greatly in reduction of stress put on the body of void travelers. With use of this method, a neural processor and interface plug is necessary for, at very least, the commanding crew of the ship, as any mobility in higher G is heavily obstructed.

Second, more expensive option that is often used in cooperation to lying position, is the usage of High-G Mitigation Suits (HCMS), that use a combination of microhydraulics - regulating the pressure on human body in real time, artificial muscles - used to dynamically support user body, and active compression - compression of the body to prevent blood flow away from the brain and improve circulation.

The third and relatively most advanced method is Fluid Breathing. During acceleration, air in the lungs becomes a problem - it can collapse under pressure or make it difficult to fill. An oxygen-rich fluid, a state of art mix of chemicals from both Gaia and colonies, can replace air, allowing pressure to be evenly distributed throughout the lungs. This eliminates the risk of crushing the rib cage and improves the body’s ability to function under high-g forces. This option is almost exclusively used on top of all stated above and under drug-induced coma, as filling of lungs with fluid might be a traumatic experience even for the most hardened veterans of void travels.

Altogether, those four methods of high-g pressure reduction and existence of highly efficient fusion drives that can accelerate ships rapidly in a short span of time, allow humanity to spread through any star system that they encounter, which crushing 196.2 m/s² or 20G pressure on the human body.

## HUMANITY

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/cJPVWXm4/michael-wakeley-orisonsizing01.jpg" alt="TECH PIC 1">

Humanity, even with all technological and magical development achieved through the ages, is not so different from what it was before reaching the first alien star. The same possibilities, problems and challenges, just on a much greater scale and with much more drama than before. 

But before we get into all the negative energy of the humankind galaxy, let's show at least a few examples of the good things that humanity actually achieved. 

Many diseases that were plaguing humanity earlier in times have been  gotten rid of thanks to both magical innovations, as well as access to new minerals and substances from newly discovered planets. At the same time, many of the new even more deadly pathogens were discovered, contracted and to the point, spread around the known human worlds. Fortunately only those least deadly were actually widely spread and not taken care of… to a certain point of course.

Some of the parasites found a new home among humanity, and traveled with them just like rats once were able to get into voids habitats. To this day one of the most crucial parts of any space travel is to be sure you are adequately checked for lice and so on. After all, certain things never actually change. 

When it comes to medicine, and especially to helping those in most crucial need, history has noticed many breakthroughs that not only extended a standard length of life, for those who can afford it, but also in terms of prosthetics, implants and neurolinks that allowed for even greater survival rate among common people. Suddenly a lost limb or organ wasn't a death sentence without the proper help of an arcanist, and became a matter of good enough insurance and depth of your pocket. And still such development did not go unnoticed by people that more than willingly started exchanging their otherwise healthy limbs for that extra edge when it comes to both work, survivability in an unwelcome environment, or simply pulling a gun faster than the other guy ever could. Suddenly high quality implants and cybernetics found home among the rich and influential, while the cheaper end cybernetics found a less demanding pool of clients ready none less to throw their money. 

The most significant split in humanity was created by the one force that humanity was always trying to fight, and to be specific, by lack of it. In the void, dark and empty, lack of gravitation leads to change in human biology and creation of a strand to humanity. Those people who were born, lived and died in the vacuum of space quickly gained a slur name of “Drifters” as they spend their life drifting in the endless void. Beside nicknames, they additionally gained higher height, slender less muscular bodies and a much easier time readjusting to the weightlessness, at a cost of almost zero possibility of setting a foot on planets with a gravitation similar to Gaia. Fortunately, such cases are rare even now there is a constant struggle to help people with such an unwelcome change. 

Cybernetics and void living, at current time, is the most intense and visible change to the human race, beside smaller changes acquired with time on planets under the constant and costly colonization and Gaiaformation, but those even now are unimportant on a greater scale of human evolution. 

Arcanists, even though their military and combat prowess became diminished with development of weaponry, still have kept their title of most rounded-up professionals when it comes to both medicine, technology and craftsmanship, as well as being hired in positions of security providers to both government and private entities. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that even with more limited influence over the world, their position became even more confirmed in prestige as persons of high value, if not firepower. 

And at the top of the food chain of Arcanist sub society among the rest of humanity, there are disgustingly rich, influential and important Navigators. Without them there would be no interstellar travel and of that reason alone their richness turns into a golden cage in which people of power put them as a sort of deadman switch. After all, what government or corpo trusts a person who they cannot control? 

And with the existence of navigators we come into the last and greatest divider: Distance.

People living in places of great distances in between, with partially limited communication and no easy way to travel said great distances, tend to create their own morals, values and societies overall. The void of space is the greatest distance that humanity could even encounter and with which they now struggle. 

Colonies, once strongly dependent on the logistical system of Gaia, with time, development and investments, started declaring independence and fighting for it when necessary. Normal human behaviour as it is, of course couldn't lead to anything other than infighting, blood spill and great politics between planets, colonies and so on, to which we owe The Fall at the end. 

At the current moment such a split between humanity's beliefs, morals and values is clearly visible by the existence of both the Protectorate of Core Systems and all the rebel groups standing on their own against a greatest political entity known to humankind. What will be the outcome of that fight? Perhaps time will show, perhaps your action might define it. 

## POLITICS

Until now we talk about setting, space travel and humanity as a social species that still have a lot of problems going on. So for now let's get into what makes people, corporations and planets move, which is the political situation taking place in the known piece of human colonized galaxy. 

Currently, we can talk about two major players on the galaxy map, consisting of the Protectorate of Core Systems, Unified Front of Independent Systems and three minor ones, including both Confederated Planets on the edge of known space, and few independent militias operating over dozens of colonies and frontier worlds.

Every single one of them believes that war is going to an end, but how it is gonna end is a matter of their own beliefs… or delusions. Truth is a lot more merciless than whatever many of them think, but that's the matter we're gonna talk about at the end of this chapter.

We're gonna start with an explanation of what earlier political entities truly are, what their government type, their militaries and fleet working ideas, and finally how those entities overall treat their own citizens. At the end I will talk a bit about how those entities view and treat each other.

### Protectorate of Core Systems - PCS, Protectorate

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XvmGsJhG/07b477c0608aac5c753e3f07c5e7c45c.jpg" alt="TECH PIC 1">

**Broad description**

Protectorate existence started on Gaia - origin planet of humanity - when after The Fall and ongoing unrest, a group of high ranking military commanders decided to strike a deal together with biggest and most influential corporations operating from Gaia solar system.

On a slowly dying home planet to the biggest human population in the galaxy, this unprecedented alliance used all available resources to forcefully put an end to the threat of incoming nuclear warfare between falling nations. As a result, a new world order was established and formalized with the creation of the Central Council, the decisive body of PCS.

From the Gaia system the greatest military operation in human history began and spread over all known human colonized space, in a slow but constant march. Some core worlds, colonies and frontier worlds fall into fold on their decision, either from the need of resources and access to arcanist fueled logistic routes, or welcome protectorate military forces with open arms after years of inside fights and struggles.

Others end up brought into fold with big scale military operations, consisting not only of fleet void combat, orbital strike and landing troop operations into enemy orbital infrastructure, but also a hell of massive scale planetary conflict that sharpened the teeth and claws of newly formed PCS armies.

And while there is still a lot of work to be done before the Protectorate can call a victory and start properly dealing with long term stabilization efforts, the end of the war became a visible event in the coming decade.

**Government type**

It is easy to describe the type of government responsible for control and setting directions that Protectorate follow. In the hearth, PCS is an Oligarchy where most power rests within a small group of people that follow an established doctrine. The exact doctrine is nowhere near being a public matter that anybody from that thin circle of people would be willing to share with a broad population, but for anybody even remotely interested in PCS politics it is clear that few main directions are obvious.

First of all, while most core systems and planets enjoy a lot of freedom when it comes to their own inside laws and regulations, Protectorate civil organisations oversee any major law change or an attempt to change it. At the same time, while all those systems are expected to keep their own ground peacekeeping forces and number of support vessels to keep up with policing their own territory, most interstellar military actions, movements of resources, peoples and ships are administered, organized and overseen by Protectorate fleet forces.

Second of all, a recurring theme of the Protectorate’s actions consist of nearly zealous refusal to sit and talk with any opposing forces on interstellar map, that include UFSI and any even slightly connected to them terrorist, paramilitary and so on organizations operating in protectorate space. That is not even remotely surprising, taking into consideration the fact that PCS exist in the first place, exactly because of actions taken by terrorist organisations.

Third and the last, that dominant goal of Protectorate policies and actions is a restoration of Gaia back to its original, pre Fall, state. To achieve that goal PCS is ready to establish any policy and take any actions that would benefit this goal, even if it means that certain colonies or core systems are going to need to deal with certain deficits.

---

**Military and Fleet**

To say that no other geopolitical entity in the known galaxy is capable of both production, replacement and upkeep of both arms and ships, is to say nothing. If we look at this matter from the perspective of just raw statistics and information gathered from both government and corporations managed factories and industries, none of the entities in the known galaxy altogether can compare.

For that reason alone, as much as needed for a massive, organised force capable of both policing actions, as well as near constant offensive fleet maneuvers, the PCS fleet is gigantic.

While organized into certain semi-independent operation zones, consisting of anywhere from few dozens to hundred of ships, of any class between destroyer and full-blown battleship, and even greater amount of of support units necessary for such military to operate efficiently, there are still a fleet groups that operate outside of such organization. Those fleets are especially designated for both offensive and defensive actions required to either push back any separatist or rebel forces trying to break into PCS space, or operate inside enemy territory on constant effort to put an end to The War of System Unification (WSU).

But PCSF (The Protectorate of Core Systems Fleet) is not only made up of ships and crews operating them, but also of military forces especially trained and equipped for combat missions in the void of space. Protectorate Void Combat Corp, or PVCC in short, is responsible for any sort of void combat actions, starting from holding a host of security officers on all PCS ships, to performing surgical assault on enemies space stations or recon actions on found derelict ships. It is them, who in lion share, take on rebel space stations and any orbital infrastructure.

Land forces are a lot more diverse than the fleet. The Protectorate of Core Systems Army, or PCSA, consists of top to bottom, High Command of Planetary Operations (HCPO) directly answering to the Central Council and responsible for overseeing all ground military operations taken by PCS.

HCPO in turn commands over many separate armies operating on distant theatres of conflict, consisting of a formation of five hundred thousand to even a million soldiers and their respective support personnel. It is worth mentioning that many of the field units hosted by PCSA consist of support companies of combat drones filling in empty spots created by expansive combat zones.

Beside normal men and women serving the PCSA and PCSF structures, there is no lack of Arcanist who found themselves a place among soldiers, officers and higher commanders of both fleets and armies. Usually though they are grouped under the command of The Protectorate Arcana Corps, or PAC in short, that is directly subordinate to HCPO, they are well known from assigning their own squads in aid of bigger units of army and fleets organization. It's worth mentioning that theoretically Navigators also fall under the command of PAC, but most of the time, only HCPO can actually hold them accountable.

**Life of regular citizen**

As mentioned earlier, most laws and regulations put in place on planets of PCS, are left up to their own regional governments. For that reason, when it comes to the standard of living of regular citizens, it varies greatly depending on the exact planet, current local government and even which corporations have stronger connections to the given planet.

On some core worlds like for example Xytherra, whose populations go into nearly billion already, there is a clear distinction between certain layers of the society. Lower social classes take a big part of overall operations on planets, as farming, mining and industrial complex is strongly developed and for most of the time, set to satisfy the demand of its own population, while surplus is sold of to other core world, colonies or frontier worlds in need for both resources, technologies and bright minds.

In the meanwhile, for most people living in the void of space, services like transport of resources and people is the main source of income and living. Corporations are known for using freelance ships in place of their own, whenever need arises or outsource such devious work to private contractors completely to save on cost of setting and maintaining a fleet of their own.

Many small and middle sized colonies are famous from hard conditions, tons of always open job positions, and focus on both middle class scientist and bureaucrats, and lower class workers dealing in extensive development of both living space, hydroponic farming and extensive mining operations.

On frontier planets, colonies and mining stations people are expected to be a true renaissance person of renaissance, dealing kinda with everything, from logistics, mining, transport and all services in between. There are many occasions to strike a deal of life, as long as you are smart and armed.

CPS is, as any good authoritarian political entity, fixed on establishing a society with strictly controlled gun law. In some regard and specific places, such attempts at gun control did achieve some successes, mostly when it comes to creating zones in cities and certain more strictly controlled colonies of CPS. Unfortunately, taking into consideration both scale of human controlled space territory and size of human population, most of the time guns are as cheap if not cheaper than many other basic products like phones, or sometimes food.

Protectorate enforce certain gun regulations on all aligned planets with complete disregard for their earlier, local regulations. First of all, it is up to local planetary administrations to deal with issuing a weapons permit to the citizen of their planets, but protectorate regu

Nonetheless, CPS is dealing more often with local governments and corporations organizing work of people under them, than actually engaging the local population of those given planets. Such contact, positive or negative, is mostly done with the use of local peacekeeping forces, or police departments.

Overall, by going by the rule of thumb, the higher the planet population, the lower the overall scrutiny and possibility of control of a given population. Most people live a life of low standard, work flexibility and constantly look out for a chance of a better life. Even if it would mean a life focused more on the illegal side of the law.

**Relations with others entities**

**Unified Front of Systems Independence** - PCS, at current moment, is in open military and economical conflict with UFSI. Full-on space and land battles take place at at least a dozen of colonies and systems at the current time, while commando forces operate behind UFSI lines in hope of disturbing their military complex. At the same time, special operation corps deal with any UFSI backed insurgents and rebel groups operating on PCS territory. Intelligence warfare, carried on by Protectorate Intelligence Department, is active and ongoing, focused both on military information, as much as technology and corporation backing.

**Confederated Planets** - When it comes to CP, PCS approach is somewhat more flexible in its nature. CP consist mostly of minor colonies and frontier outposts, which by itself present only a minor threat to the PCS existence and regional stability. Additionally, representatives of CP approach PCS many times with propositions of normalizing their political relations, which allow CC to delay a need for further redistribution of CPS fleets into regions under CP jurisdiction. Right at this moment CC is in a process of negotiations meaning to reintegrate CP worlds into CPS, which for most people interested in politics seems quite unlikely.

**The Ember Chain, Black Veil Accord, Iron Legion, Children of Hollow Flames** - As much as CPS understands differences and partial, or complete lack of cooperation between those groups, as much there is no different politics established by CPS when it comes to any form of contact with those groups. All of them are to be considered a terrorist organization with their own goals and agendas that are under constant scrutiny of the Protectorate Intelligence Department, or PID in short. Official position of CPS on their existence and activity

### Unified Front of Systems Independence - UFSI, Rebels

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/GhFfrTxB/homefront-the-revolution-game-4k-art-le-1400x1050.jpg" alt="TECH PIC 1">

**Broad description**

Unified Front of Systems Independence became a geopolitical entity as result of establishing CPS and War of System Unification that started to gain momentum and become a real threat for all the once Gaian colonies and core worlds that acquired their political independence in an effect of The Fall.

Even though it is a terrorist act that gave the possibility of cutting dependency from Gaia to most of the planet currently making up the UFSI, official position of UFSI government on the matter of terrorism organization, stand mostly on the same side with CPS, that is a total condemnation of their aggressive operations pointed at civilians. Nonetheless, it is not unheard of for the UFSI government to cooperate, backup and finance certain groups otherwise described as terrorist cells inside CPS territory.

Unified Front of Systems Independence present a common interest of three core worlds, standing in firm opposition to the idea of unifying all human colonized world under central rules of a geopolitical entity that no longer share a common system of belief and standards as those planets who declare their independence in good will and in support of their own populations. With that single goal in mind, UFSI fought and will continue to fight against PCS forces.

---

**Government type**

Unified Front of Systems Independence is a closely working federation of three main Core Planets, which are Eryndor, Nemoris and Pelagora. Chosen representatives form a government overseeing not only the military effort of UFSI to stand against CPS, but also lawmaking processes and slowly going integration of all controlled by their colonies and frontier world into one more united entity.

Overall cooperation between the federal government and governments of UFSI aligned planets can be described as walking on thin ice. On one side a coordinated effort to keep aligned systems from falling into hands of CPS requires resources, industry and citizens support that need to be balanced with the fact that local governments regularly change peoples in positions of power, and with that the focus of their own goals.

Some officials from the government itself claim that for exactly that reason UFSI cannot keep up with CPS when it comes to both productivity and military pressure on line of active combat. Of course such words are always taken with a little of salt, because pumping enough resources and brilliant minds into military effort, would probably transform UFSI more closely into CPS that anybody would even want.

---

**Military and Fleet**

Unified Front Fleet, or UFF in short, is a military body consisting of three fleets belonging and upkeep by Eryndor, Nemoris and Pelagora, but organized into specific strategic and tactical units by Central Fleet Command. CFC in short. 

The main part of the fleet is supplied by Eryndor, as one of the most developed and industrialized planets among three, which provide nearly fifty percent of UFSI fleet. Nemoris and Pelagora provide the rest, while also taking on themselves a burden of constant supply of fuel, ammunition and manpower. And the burden is great when facing a political entity like PCS that has an infinitely higher amount of resources, both natural and human.

The only advantage of UFF lay in the fact that in the opposition to PCS, they need to fight only on one front at the time and with extensive raiding actions, they can theoretically stall PCSF indefinitely. Unfortunately, theory is only a theory, and both time and the last big victory of PCSF shows, it's only a matter of time before PCS either transfer enough of their ships into the frontline from other less important fronts, or simply build more that UFF can stand against.

UFF is organized in a way similar to the PCS fleets, but with more focus on defensive and patrolling capabilities, while still keeping the strong tactical units of fast and capable jumps vessels with the purpose of raiding CPS logistic network, and supplying their own behind enemy lines. With later defeats taken by the UFF fleet, more effort and supplies were put into both modernization of older units, while brain work began with the idea of a new, better standard model of space combat capable vessel that might equal chances. 

Such a project is a first multi worlds enterprise and strictly kept under federal government overview. Until now, most of the ships were either of stolen pre PCS design, or designed separately by federated core worlds fleets commands. 

One thing doesn't change that much though, even with stronger and stronger pulls into creating more united fleets forces. All planets provide their own marines for their ship, and interplanetary space marines actions are still in a way of development. For that reason, the weaponry and armory of each of the core world marines forces is quite diversified.

Similar problems bother the ground forces of UFSI, but fortunately to a much lesser degree. Ground forces in a way similar to space one, divide each other depending on planet of origin, but fall under the command of Unified Front Army, which distributes its forces according to need of the frontline. 

With not a small opposition in government, UFSI passed a new executive order of raising a force of federal ground army, that at the current moment would consist of fresh recruits and volunteers from already existing units of Core Planets ground armies. As a new formation their military achievements are not many yet, but with increasing need for ground forces and war approaching closer and closer to unified core systems, that may change soon. 

---

**Life of regular citizen**

Life of an everyday citizen of UFSI is mostly defined by a planet of their origin, rather than by federal regulations and laws, yet still certain parts of their life share a unifying standard. 

For example, new standardized id documentation for all current citizens of UFSI systems has become more and more widely spread, allowing for easier travel between federated systems and the planets. At the same time, many of either less progressive or simply less advanced colonies strongly refused implementation of new types of identity documents, focusing more on their own local version, that in theory are equally respected among UFSI systems. 

Another such change comes with the introduction of digital and easier to transfer between network and systems currency called UCC - United Currency Credit. This currency was supposed to ease economical exchange between federated planets, but was met with distrust and political smearing campaign, as such currency was all too close and familiar to PCS credits. Nonetheless, introduction was enforced by forced interplanetary transactions directives. Unfortunately on federated planets UC credits are still in minority usage and local currencies hold a strong grip on their citizens bank accounts and saving physically kept at home. 

---

**Relations with others entities**

***Protectorate of Core Systems*** - at the current moment UFSI is in a state of open war with PCS forces, with the main goal of making Central Council on Gaia to accept independence of federated systems, either by the evidence of impossible to realise victory goals of PCS, or by draining Protectorate resources for long ago so their own citizens make Central Council to stop all aggressive actions and finally sit down to negotiations table. Nonetheless, UFSI stand strong in their opposition to any chances of ending this war without keeping their independence. 

**Confederated Planets**** - The difficulty of UFSI dealings with the CP government and their individual planets lay in two separate problems. First is the distance and overall lack of interstellar constant and secured connection between their both respected planets, imposed by PCS territory existing in the middle of their theoretical line of communication. Second one is the near complete lack of willingness and intention of the CP government in dealing with UFSI, as federated planets are viewed by CP as pain in the ass, making their own political dealing with PCS a lot harder in a process of theoretically similar existence and view of a matter of keeping independence. Positive aspect of this situation lay in the fact that CP is not interested in any economic or military conflict with UFSI, making their diplomatic relations semi stable

**The Ember Chain, Black Veil Accord, Iron Legion, Children of Hollow Flames** - Officially UFSI federal government stands in opposition to any armed groups which use violence and terror against civilian population, and by such refuse to cooperate with them. Under the table, on the opposite side, many of those mentioned and not mentioned groups received impressive support from the UFSI government in form financial, humanitarian and military aid (which include fighting arm to arm against CPS soldiers in some battles) As the unrest and keeping PCS forces busy lay in the interest of UFSI, such groups make a good silent ally in prolonging conflicts between UFSI and PCS, while draining resources of only PCS. Noneless, some of those mentioned groups are also in open conflict with UFSI forces and government, which makes their enemy no less dangerous than PCS, while also draining UFSI resources to fight back against their growing influence.

## ARCANA

**Origin and Nature of the Source**

At the core of the Arcanist’s power is the Source — an invisible lattice beneath physics, an anomaly that mocks measurement yet bends reality when willed to obey. To ordinary eyes, the Source is untraceable: no scanner, no collider, no deep-space probe can pin it down. But its fingerprints mark every major leap of human expansion into the void.

The Source is not magic in the sense of fairy tales — it’s a raw potential, a silent contradiction woven into existence. Humanity’s best minds have wrestled with it for millennials, and they remain divided. Some call it quantum foam triggered by certain neurochemical states — the Quantum Hypothesis. Others claim it’s a divine spark left by ancient godlike beings — the Divine Echo. A third camp sees it as cosmic residue — reality’s leftover fragments bleeding through microscopic tears in the universal fabric. None has proof that satisfies everyone, but all agree: when shaped correctly, the Source lets humans defy nature’s rigid rules of the universe.

Arcanists are the wielders of this force — the only ones who can push void-ships from gravitational chains of one star to another, terraform an airless rock into a habitable world, or maintain deep-space habitats where metal alone would crumble. No ship crosses interstellar space without an Arcanist at the helm.

---

**Finding, Forging, and Unleashing the Next Generation**

Not every human can touch the Source. The spark is rare — a genetic quirk or some whisper, the faint echo of older bloodlines reaching back to the first Wells. 

There is no pattern to it, even though many tried to find it. No scanner can confirm it outright. Instead, signs appear early: impossible coincidences around a child, sudden cold spots, tiny distortions in local gravity when they cry.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7ZmT2DkJ/no-spoilers-i-wouldve-loved-to-see-this-scene-in-game-v0-vlu3a9j0vhld1.webp" alt="TECH PIC 1">

Families in the Core Worlds know what to do — they report it. In mining colonies and fringe stations, some hide it, hoping to train a secret shaper for profit or power. Such secrets rarely last. Protectorate inspectors, corporate talent-hunters, or Academy recruiters always come knocking. When they do, there’s no negotiation: the child leaves.

Training begins in brutal simplicity. Raw talent means nothing if the will is weak. Recruits are shipped to Academy hubs — fortress campuses hidden under ice sheets, buried in asteroid cores, or orbiting gas giants under constant surveillance. Only the Academy of Gaia is different, located on an isolated island, far from unwanted eyes and unwanted attention. 

There, drills break the body first — forced fasting, sensory deprivation, endless equations burned into tired minds. If they crack, they’re out — if they survive, they touch the Source under supervision, shaping tiny flickers of energy into controlled patterns.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/g2J21ZCY/3d7a7379377fcf45575e96566657ecde.jpg" alt="TECH PIC 1">

Most students wash out by design. A mind that can’t hold perfect focus is a liability waiting to become a catastrophe. Failure is better in the controlled walls of an Academy than inside a fragile orbital habitat or a jump capable vessel. Some fail so spectacularly they never leave — sterile dorms and sealed rooms hide broken minds that babble half-finished statements for the rest of their lives.

Those who endure graduate into positions of higher freedom — licensed ranks that limit how far they can push the Source without oversight. Apprentice's shadow Masters, build their weaving credentials, and prove they won’t crack under pressure. The best of Graviturgist join the Navigators’ path — and spend years more learning to ride pass between star systems without becoming fused debris floating between in the void.

When the Academy signs the final release, the new Arcanist steps into a galaxy hungry for their talent — and ready to chain it. Contracts wait, corporate agents circle, military recruiters whisper promises of glory. A few go rogue early, fleeing the Core for fringe colonies where law is thin and Wells lie unguarded. Most comply — for a time.

All of them carry the same lesson out with them: the Source does not care about loyalty or ambition. It tests the mind every time it bends — and keeps testing, until it breaks. And when it does, someone else finds the next child, marks the next spark, and starts the cycle over again.

---

**From Novice to Master**

Becoming an Arcanist is not exactly a gift — it’s a brutal commitment. Will is the blade; knowledge is the grindstone. No apprentice touches the Source until they can map atomic lattices in their mind, feel chemical bonds like muscle memory, and calculate vectors of force to a decimal. An Arcanist must trick reality into rewriting itself, balancing the equation of matter and energy with the cruel logic of physics.

Failure is common. Neural collapse, psychosis, or spontaneous death are the price of miscalculation. Many fry their synapses before they ever coax copper into gold or turn air into water. The Academy drills this lesson relentlessly: the Source is not a loophole in physics — it’s a transaction bound by the Rule of Equal Exchange. Every shaping devours something else: heat for cold, mass for transmutation, air for barriers, fuel for flame. Nothing comes free, and any rumor of ancient Arcanists creating something from nothing is mostly a cautionary myth — the stories always end with the same warning: the debt always collects.

---

**The Circles and Law**

Unchecked, an Arcanist is a catastrophe. Early expansions proved that painfully. On fringe colonies, rogue Arcanists turned entire valleys to glass, pushing terraforming too far until biomes rebelled. 

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wjJGqf8J/d40478e485e7a98cb86c3e0f6753b027.jpg" alt="TECH PIC 1">

In the aftermath, humanity forged the Codex — rigid tome of law and regulations that bound Arcanist wherever he is, and set a straight clarification to the ways the Source should be used, without place for interpretation. Of course, not everybody adheres to the law. 

Within its vast body of knowledge, the Codex defines Circles — distinct orders of practitioners who wield the Source through specialized disciplines. Thermaturgists transcend the conventional laws of thermodynamics and command the flow of energy. Aethermancers harness the principles of electromagnetism and electrical manipulation. Alchemists manipulate matter at the atomic level, transforming its fundamental structure. Flowmancers govern fluid dynamics and atmospheric forces. Graviturgists exert influence over spatial dimensions and gravitational fields. Biomancers master the manipulation of biological systems and neural pathways.

Unlicensed Source practice is illegal — usually, but not always, a capital crime. A neighbor caught turning pets into spare organs, a cult attempting to influence Wells with a human sacrifice within an illegal ritual, a rogue Arcanists working with a pirate band terrorizing frontier jump lane — these threats forced the PCS, UFSI, CP to anchor use of the Source in law, backed by orbital kill grids, black ops teams and establishment of the Academy. 

The Academy is a pretty term used to describe an organization associating (finding, training and licensing) all the Source users within individual local Academies range. Officially independent, in reality, closely working with political establishment in a truly symbiotic relationship, using and keeping Arcanist under a widely defined control.

---

**Wells and the Anchors of Power**

Wells are the bleeding hearts of the Source — anomalies where its density spikes enough to feed major projects. They lie under continents, orbit dead stars, or pulse deep in the crust of fringe planetoids. An Anchor Well - Navigation Beacon building zone on the surface of a planet, is guarded like nothing else in the universe: orbital fleets, kill grids, local and corporate ground forces. 

Back in the days of old, before the discovery of interstellar travel, wars between rival Arcanist associations have been fought, won and lost, just to get a hold over a single Well. Nowadays, all belong to Academies and governments that they work with.

No one has ever created a stable Well from scratch — many tried, all failed. Labs blew apart in pseudo-singularities or fizzled in sterile static. Rumors swirl about a lost Master who shaped a mobile Well, a wandering power source that could free Arcanists from Academy chains forever — but no credible evidence has surfaced. If it did, the hunt would be apocalyptic.

Wells attract more than corporations and governments. They pull cults and sects that worship the Source as divine — chanting, sacrificing, or commiting a mass suicides in the name of anomalies they barely understand. Official doctrine calls this superstition, but field agents whisper of Wells that “answer” back. Or at least something that whispers back.

---

**Navigators: Arcanists Among the Stars**

The most revered — and controlled — Arcanists are Navigators. Without them, interstellar travel is impossible. They alone can move between stars with nothing but their mind, folding hulls and cargo between constellations in an instant. 

This feat is never safe: the human brain isn’t built for raw Source shaping at the scale of an ARCS-class ship, a behemoth carrying entire cities through the void. Navigators suffer strokes, seizures, or sudden death mid-jump. Debris sometimes reappears decades later: ships fused with crew, metal tangled with bone.

Because Navigators are so critical, they live in gilded cages — showered in wealth but watched relentlessly by corporations and their Academies. A rogue Navigator with an ARCS can vanish into rebel space and become a strategic nightmare — a single ship that breaks siege lines, runs blockades, or seeds new colonies beyond the reach of an organized government.

---

**The Source in the Void**

The Source acts differently outside planetary gravity wells. In microgravity, shaping becomes sharper, faster, more volatile. This is why Navigators thrive in the void but struggle planetside. 

Graviturgy — the shaping of local spacetime — turns energy of the void born Wells into a fuel that pushes ships between stars. Without it, no human would reach Nyxalis, Eryndor, Pelagora, or the dozen other worlds now hosting billions.

On the fringes, rogue Arcanists flee to forgotten rocks where the Source flows pure and Wells lie hidden under dead crust. They push forbidden ideas where the Academies sensors can’t reach — some succeed for years, until containment fails. Then comes pain, destruction and in best case soldiers in ships, rewriting logs with mining accident cover stories.

---

**Hybridization and the Limits of Machine**

Every generation tries to bind the Source to machines alone — a dream of ships that navigate themselves, factories that warp matter on command, armies of drones spinning new alloys from nothing. It never works. 
The Source demands a living mind: a will, sharp and disciplined, weaving the molecules. At best, hardware can amplify an Arcanist’s power — neural links, exosuits, mental stabilizers. But without a mind driving the pattern, the Source collapses.
Dark labs have tried neural grafts: splicing Arcanist brain tissue into AIs Mainframe. The results are monstrous: husks that loop half-finished shapings until containment ruptures. Those sites are sealed or scrubbed from records.

---

**Weaponizing the Source**

Turning the Source into a stable weapon has haunted generals and warlords for centuries. It looks perfect on paper: if an Arcanist can ignite the air or bend spacetime to move fleets, why not turn them into living bombs?

Reality says otherwise. Weaving the Source demands focus and discipline — two things war destroys first. The battlefield is chaos. A stray bullet, panic, pain — one crack in the shaper’s mind, and the pattern collapses. When it fails, backlash doesn’t care who’s in the blast zone.

Wars on Gaia, long centuries ago, proved this brutally. Rogue Arcanists wiped towns and villages in a matter of minutes — then lost control, turning entire valleys to glass. Nowadays, terraforming used as a weapon backfires as often as it works, turning into acid storms that burn cities to ruin and massacre civilian populations.

Modern militaries learned fast. Instead of living nukes, they use Arcanists as force multipliers: a Thermaturgist setting landing zones ablaze to flush out defenders; a Graviturgist pulling orbital junk down on enemy ships; a Biomancer stripping pathogens or choking supply lines with twisted flora.

But every advantage has a counter. Snipers, drones, kill teams — all designed to drop an Arcanist before they have a chance to hit the battlefield a second time. For every myth of a city-flattening Arcanist, a bullet still ends the threat faster than any use of the Source.

Rumors persist of darker projects — bombs enchanted by use of the Source enchanted isotopes, plagues crafted by rogue Biomancers. Some failed in transit, tearing stations apart or vanishing labs into micro voids. Others never worked at all — because when the mind behind a Weaving dies, so does the Source interest in bending reality. 

So the ultimate Source weapon remains a rumor — a story to keep new Arcanists obedient. For now, power still needs flesh, and flesh still bleeds like it always did. Until someone shapes a pattern that survives its maker, wars will stay old-fashioned: fought with bullets, ships, and the fragile brains of those willing to bend reality — if they live long enough to finish the job.

---

**Culture, Faith, and Heresy**

Where the Source pools, belief festers. Humans can’t stare at reality, bending anomalies forever and stay rational. Wells, minors and unworthy of the Academy's attention, become shrines. Miners slip offerings into cracks — hair, coins, a drop of blood — hoping the Source doesn’t shift wrong and kill them. To this day no one has proved that such a slight shift is even possible, or do anything to land around.

Old noble houses claim they carry the “Gift” in their veins — as if the Source respects bloodlines. Some hoard relics: shards of crystallized bone, scraps of metal touched by weaved Source, teeth of a famous Arcanist from a long gone age.
Breakaway sects push belief further. They twist the Divine Echo into doom: the Source is the cosmos’ secret heartbeat, and Arcanists are parasites eating it alive. They build monasteries on dead moons, gather at hidden Wells, chant, bleed, and vanish. Sometimes they leave behind fractures in physics — drone images show impossible angles, warped rock, local gravity bent sideways. 

For some it's a sign that they waited for confirmation that the Source listened and acted when pleased. Others claim it's something darker, some deity who feeds on those foolish to unknowingly pray to them instead. No one knows the truth beside those already gone.

The Academy calls it superstition. Field agents know better. If cultists disappear cleanly, they say the Well “answered.” Faith burns bodies into rumor — and rumor feeds more faith. Every cycle leaves a lesson for sane Arcanists: never mistake power for permission.

---

**The Source and Society**

Arcanists stand at the center of a hard bargain: envied, feared, indispensable — yet owned. Every starship jump, terraformed wasteland, or orbital city depends on them. Without them, the domes crack and crops rot in poisoned soil.

Corporations compete to bind Arcanists in endless contracts. Governments write laws that look like freedom but bury claws in fine print. An unlicensed Arcanist is a threat: a rogue Biomancer can twist a city’s water supply; a rogue Navigator can vanish a precious ARCt into rebel space.

Navigators live best — or worst. Riches, mansions, medical wards to keep their minds sharp. But drones watch them sleep, implants track localization, kill teams stand ready if they stray. One Navigator switching sides can keep a rebel stronghold alive for decades.

Lower-ranked Arcanists fare a little better. A Terraformer saves a dying colony — but only under threat of debt or quiet erasure. Rogue shapers work black jobs: sabotage, Well info-theft, assassinations. Slip up, and they’re erased as if they never lived.

Despite all this, the Source makes them essential. No Source, no interstellar civilization. That’s the paradox: power enough to lift billions — yet always leased on someone else’s terms.

---

**Suppressed Theories and Hidden Dangers**

Officially, only three theories explain the Source. But behind locked archives lie pages no student sees. One forbidden idea: the Source bends more easily for minds that reflect its raw chaos — not sentient, but reactive. Each shaping sands away part of the shaper’s identity until what’s left is barely human.

Another theory claims Wells are artifacts — leftovers of older Source-bearers who weaved first stars before humans ever crawled out of the ocean. If so, humans didn’t discover the Source — they scavenged it.

The worst secret says the Source isn’t energy at all — it’s time. Each shaping steals seconds from somewhere else: a future life, a distant place. Every interstellar jump, every forced valley of crops, is a fracture in the timeline that bleeds consequences humanity hasn’t begun to measure.

Such secrets bury those who dig. Researchers vanish, professors “accidentally” die. The deeper the truth, the deeper the grave.

---

**Final Truth**

Beneath the laws, contracts, and prayers, one truth holds: the Source does not care. It isn’t loyal to licenses, faith, or bloodlines. It obeys only as long as your mind stays sharp — as long as the weave holds clean. Doubt, fear, arrogance — they ruin the pattern. When it fails, the Source slips away and leaves you broken.

Some Arcanists burn out in storms that scorch continents. Others fade quietly, neurons fried after decades of weaving. A lucky few bow out early, hiding in orbital estates, hoping they die before the debt comes due, and go for early retirement when they pay out debt to the Academy with their work.

Yet every year, thousands stand in line at the Academy’s gates, sure they’ll beat the odds — that their will is unbreakable. They forget the final rule whispered by those who know: 

**We don’t own the Source — we rent it. And the rent is always due.**

## FAITH

**The Fractured Pantheons**

In the Ashes of Gaia tangled expanse, there is no single god, no universal pantheon stretching from Core Worlds to fringe colonies of frontier. Instead, faith is fractured into countless pantheons — vast in some cultures, sparse in others, each built around local need and memory.

The Seravano keep nearly ten gods on their altars, each shouldering a tight domain: harvest, wind, trade, death, the bonds of family. Every domain is tangled in rituals passed through centuries of priesthood. Offerings are exact, prayers are memorized word for word. The smallest slip can insult a god — or so the elders say.

By contrast, the Khargan place all trust in the Sun. One burning sovereign who guards the daylight, banishes the creeping dark, and watches over all good things that claw life out of the hard soil. One god means no confusion, no overlap, no councils of squabbling deities — just a single divine judge who sees virtue and weakness alike.

Between these extremes lie countless faiths: Seyandru believes in the Sisters of the Desert, two spirits bound in eternal rivalry over drought and bounty, among many more minor deities. Nauhiri who once inhabited the western ranges of the islands for centuries, now bring to distant new planets their belief in Drowned God, who stirs oceans giving his verdict or blessing on the ships passing through his domain. Those who once lived on the western continent, still hold to the deep belief of Shen Wang, their god-king who before the first script was ever written, laid the foundation for the Wuu culture. 

Yet patterns repeat. Gods of sun, war, love, the moon — they echo under different names, clad in local myths that shift from region to region. A Khargan pilgrim might trade nods with a Sharak-Zoran elder who prays to Khor-Ra, the god of light and all that lives beneath the sun. The cults differ — but the heat on their backs, the faith in the dawn, remains the same.

---

**Saints, Spirits, and Bloodlines**

Where gods loom distant, saints walk closer. Saints are humanity’s claim that the divine can mark a mortal life — proof that a god’s favor can be so potent it reshapes flesh and legacy.

Among the Seravano and Cyrathians, stories swirl of saints who survived plagues untouched, carried crops to starving villages in baskets that never emptied, or laid dying to cleanse a valley of corruption. Their names become prayers, their graves pilgrimage sites. In their bones lies no magic — but pilgrims swear that sleeping by a saint’s tomb grants luck in the next harvest or heals a wound that otherwise would be incurable.

The Cyrathian archives record lines of saints stretching back centuries — a living chain of blood and belief. In some households, faith is inheritance as real as any coin or farmland. Grandparents speak of a cousin’s cousin who once saw a saint step barefoot across burning coals to calm a crowd’s rage. Whether true or not, the stories shape families. Children grow up repeating old names, wearing worn talismans said to hold a whisper of divine attention.

Other cultures lean on the half-mortal, half-divine. The Skeldriths and Inuyaka tell of demigods — children fathered by divine sparks or mothers who dreamt of gods so vividly they birthed beings too strong, too strange for common life. Demigods stalk legends: giants who built cities in a single generation, twins who fought each other across continents, leaving valleys where their bodies fell during fight.

Lesser spirits hang at the edges of this belief. Not gods — never that grand — but small forces that slip into folk tales. Forest shades of Hanyue, wind ghosts of Kiyora, ancestors who stand watch over a household’s threshold shared by both and more. Their worship is scattered, more custom than creed. But to the old and the frightened, they are a hedge against the vastness of the universe.

---

**Gods Who Never Speak**

A faithful life is a life of unanswered questions. In this age, gods do not descend in blazing forms, do not sit at feasting tables, do not trade words like old friends. They do not speak plainly, if they speak at all.

They press their will through dreams, but even these are murky — glimpses of rivers that might stand for fate, symbols of animals whose meanings split the priesthood into bickering schools. A child dreams of a winged serpent coiling around the sun: a sign of plague to come, says Kiyoran cleric. A promise of a great leader, says a priest from among the people of Inuyaka. The gods remain silent either way.

When they act, it’s through blessings woven into mortal life — an illness that vanishes overnight, a sudden surge of strength in a battle where death seemed certain, a barren field blooming overnight in defiance of drought.

Histories speak of older days when gods walked Gaia’s surface in flesh — or so the stories claim. Records are brittle, contradictory. A Khargan stone tablet says the Sun God lifted mountains to fence out the void’s cold breath. A Seravano hymn hints that the Viridanius once wore mortal skin to guide a lost tribe across rocky, wild planes.

The University of History on Gaia files these as folklore — proof of humanity’s hunger for order in chaos. But in the frontier stations, where walls groan and air recyclers fail, it’s enough for a frightened crew to believe a god might still watch them through the bulkhead glass.

**Temples, Prophets, and Cults**

Faith needs structure — and humanity builds it from marble, circuit boards, and whispered prayers in hidden cellars.

Most major gods keep formal houses: temples of cut stone or alloy domes orbiting planets too hostile for mortal life. Priests stand as custodians, trained from youth in rites, myths, and the delicate balancing act of faith and politics.

In Seravano cities, vast temple districts host thousands: pilgrims shuffling under colored banners, priests chanting hymns older than some nations, altars humming with offerings both symbolic and real — oil, coins, data-chits worth fortunes. In Khargan enclaves, a single towering shrine crowned in polished gold reflects the sun’s rays so fiercely that it can blind pilgrims who fail to bow low enough.

Yet faith leaks past marble walls. Prophets appear where temples fail — wanderers in ragged robes who speak visions in market squares, slum alleys, or frozen mining rigs on the asteroid fringe. Some spark revivals; others vanish, murdered or burned when their visions clash with sanctioned doctrine.

And always, hidden cults fester beneath the surface. They take commandments and twist them until even gods might struggle to recognize their own worshippers. A god of harvest becomes a god of blood, demanding sacrifice of rivals’ livestock — then rivals themselves. A sun cult locks entire families inside mirrored chambers, believing that light alone will cleanse sin.

Governments tolerate temples. They watch prophets with wary eyes. Cults, though, draw fire — covert squads, surveillance grids, unmarked ships slipping down from orbit to scrub nests of heresy before they bloom into open threat.

**Inheritance and Heresy**

Priesthood is not born of blood alone — but blood has its hooks in every order. Among dominant temples, priests train in schools attached to sanctuaries: rigorous drills in scripture, oratory, rites of cleansing. They learn the old tongues, memorize genealogies of saints and demigods, debate doctrine until they can recite it in sleep.

But some gods favor narrower lines. In river villages, a priesthood might pass from father to son, mother to daughter — a hidden chain of blessing that official temples claim is “unregulated.” In some sects, only men or only women may tend the altar, stand inside the sacred circle, touch the relics kept behind stone seals.

Then come the self-made: the self-proclaimed prophets and priests who rise where shrines crumble or faith fades. They claim visions, sometimes true, sometimes the fevered echoes of ambition. A few last long enough to draw flocks of desperate followers. Most burn out — or are hunted down when they twist commandments into threats too dangerous for the cities and domes that pretend civilization is civilized.

Where commandments bend, heresy grows. Any faith flexible enough to welcome a dozen ways to worship will spawn a thirteenth that sours into something else. Cults fester on the edge of civilization: worshippers wearing flesh masks, hoarding relics said to whisper secrets when the moons align. For every high temple’s polished sermon, there is a basement where someone sharpens a blade for sacrifice in a god’s name the original followers would not claim.

---

**Blessings and Their Boundaries**

For all the grandeur of temples and the terror of cults, the real proof of the gods lives in blessings — unpredictable gifts dropped into mortal hands.

A devout soldier finds that bullets curve wide or jam just as they should. A child orphaned by plague walks through flame and emerges unscathed. A prophet sees visions of storms before they break, warning a village in time to board up houses and flee to high ground.

Yet these gifts obey a hard limit: no blessing grants command of the Source. No priest or prophet, no matter how pure, shapes matter or warps gravity. That realm belongs only to Arcanists — those who tear holes in reality by trained will alone. The closest a blessed mortal comes is the uncanny sense that something unnatural draws near. Some claim the truly faithful can smell an Arcanist before they appear — a whiff of metal and ozone in the air, a prickle of dread in the bones.

Blessings fade with faltering faith. The gods do not lock power into flesh forever. Let belief rot, betray an oath, lose the thread of devotion — and the gift slips away, leaving only memory. Some interpret this as mercy; others, a threat.

And despite grim stories, there are no cursed blessings in the sense of a divine trap. Gods don’t twist boons into monsters. Instead, the danger comes from mortals who bend gifts into horror on their own. A boxer granted iron resilience uses it to break faces until no opponent stands. A zealot blessed with visions turns them into excuses to torch entire settlements. The blessing remains pure — the mortal does the twisting.

---

**Wars of Mortals, Silence of Gods**

If the gods fight, they do so behind curtains mortals cannot lift. No war in known history shows evidence of direct divine armies clashing in the sky, or sun deities crossing swords over continents.

Instead, mortals draw the lines, raise the banners, swing the blades. The old histories drip with holy wars: the Khargan crusades under the Sun God’s blazing eye, entire cities razed, farmland salted to purge rival faiths. Sharak-Zorans priest-kings once waged a century of “garden wars” to root out cults that claimed the Inuyaka blood hungry gods demanded sacrifice of the disloyal.

Today, true holy wars are rare at empire scale. No major government wages open crusade — but the fringes run red with smaller zealot conflicts. Fanatics strike deep-space supply lines in the name of gods who hate the profit-hungry Core worlds. Rogue prophets stir up half-broken colonies, promising salvation through terror and burnt offerings. Guerrilla fighters scrawl prayers on ammo crates, convinced their cause is righteous enough to draw divine favor.

Governments watch these sparks with cold pragmatism. Freedom of belief is tolerated — until it threatens the stability of oxygen filters, navigation beacons, or fragile settlements hanging one hull crack from extinction. Then faith becomes sedition, and sedition is crushed in silence.

---

**The Endless Contradictions**

In this fractured galaxy, faith is a mirror that reflects all extremes. The same gods who bless wandering healers also crown tyrants. A city might build its wealth on harvests claimed to be gifts from the Viridanius — while its rulers quietly drain neighboring towns, razing fields to keep their own sacred promise fed.

The faithful learn to live with paradoxes. Ask a temple scribe in the Core why the Sun God shields both saints and monsters and you’ll get soft shrugs or neat lines from old scripture about “testing the righteous.” Ask a street-corner preacher on a mining rock why the Drowned God floods one rig while sparing another, and you’ll hear that the drowned lacked piety — unless they didn’t, in which case they died for a greater lesson no mortal can read.

Most people, truth be told, live between the poles. They hedge bets, pray when afraid, break vows when hunger bites, then pray again. They give coins to the temple for luck, then slip a token under their pillow at night for the old forest shade their grandmother whispered about. Only a few run full tilt into extremism — fanatics who starve themselves for a sign, soldiers who believe dying for a righteous case will grant them a hero’s afterlife.

And so, temples and cults thrive alike — because humans want faith to make sense of cruelty, to excuse victory and soften loss. Philosophers twist this tension into endless debate: if a god wants only worship, does it matter if the worshipper is good? If the blessing rewards faith alone, is the deed irrelevant? In polished university halls, such questions end in polite applause and footnotes. On backwater moons, they end in gunfire and shallow graves.

---

**Prophets, Blasphemers, and the Skeptics**

Prophets keep popping up wherever faith runs dry or festers too long in the dark. Sometimes they are bright flares — a woman on a main square steps forward, trembling, eyes rolling white, voice booming with words she swears are not her own. She names storms before they rise, predicts famines that strike exactly when she said they would. For a while, crowds listen.

Then she says too much. Calls the wrong priesthood corrupt. Proclaims a hidden god above the old ones, or claims she is a god’s next incarnation. Soon the crowds scatter, the faithful turn, the knives come out.

Philosophers live longer than prophets — usually. They gather under orbital domes or gather old scrolls from ancient ruins on Gaia. They pick at contradictions with words sharper than blades: If gods exist, do they care? If they care, why remain silent while children starve under holy spires? Debate earns them students, patrons, and enemies in equal measure. The devout dismiss them as parasites gnawing at the roots of belief — but some temples quietly keep philosophers on payroll, hoping to turn doubt into doctrine before it becomes revolt.

Scientists, too, poke at faith’s flanks. The Academy funds projects to chart divine blessings — to measure luck statistically, to dissect “miracles” for hidden triggers. No lab has ever bottled a god’s presence. The best they produce are probability charts: the faithful do seem to survive airlock breaches more often than their peers, but no machine can pin the reason down. For every statistic, there is a counterexample — a priest found dead in a vacuum suit he trusted too long.

---

**The Afterlife, the Uncertain Gate**

When breath stops, the temples say the soul starts its journey — but no two cultures agree on where that path ends.

The Seravano teach that the dead walk a garden path beneath endless sun, tended by saints who prune the faithful’s regrets like old vines. The Khargan whisper that the righteous stand before the Sun God’s burning throne — stand too long, and your sins scorch away until only pure light remains. The Cyrathians believe in a wheel: die here, live again there, new skin for an old soul to test fresh virtues or repeat old sins.

Nauhiri says the dead slip back into the earth, rejoining the pulse of the world — not souls, but nutrients, thought returned to soil and stone. On deep space rigs, lonely engineers offer tokens to the void, hoping the cold black folds them into its silence when their lungs finally give out.

Ghost stories linger, of course — they always do. A dead sister’s face in the corridor glass. A phantom hand pulling a miner from a cave-in seconds before the collapse. But no proof endures. Even Arcanists, who twist the laws of reality daily, scoff at these tales. If ghosts walked alongside the living, they’d know — or so they claim.

And the gods stay silent about what waits on the other side. They bless, they warn, they punish or reward — but no faithful soul has returned from the final darkness with more than another story to tell.

---

**Relics and False Divinity**

Faith breeds relics — and relics breed temptation.

Real relics hold no true power once their bearer falls. A saint’s bones are bones. A demigod’s blade is steel, shaped well but not enchanted. Yet the faithful cling to them anyway. To kneel beside a splinter of staff said to once strike a tyrant down is, to many, the same as touching the god’s shadow.

In city temples, relics rest behind armored glass: chipped helmets, rings, cloth scraps folded into sealed boxes. Pilgrims leave offerings in neat lines — a coin, a drop of blood, a promise they’ll break by morning. Sometimes the relic inspires true good: a town feeds its poor for a season because a saint’s tooth arrived in a holy envoy’s box. Other times, relics rot faith into control. A warlord waves a supposed finger-bone of a sun demigod and rallies thousands to purge “nonbelievers” living quiet lives behind neutral walls.

False divinity rises wherever relics and desperation meet. Some cults crown living humans as gods reborn — a merchant’s son who suddenly preaches in perfect scriptural riddles; a scarred war orphan who claims visions of every heresy hidden in the Core’s steel veins. The crowds gather, believe, kill for proof. But when the prophet bleeds like any mortal — or flees when the airlock hisses open — faith turns fast to fury.

No true believer has ever become a god. The galaxy’s archives hold no record of mortal flesh surviving the leap from worshipped to worshipper. But the dream flickers on — and the consequences stain new altars every cycle.

---

**The Gods and the Source: Two Solitudes**

One truth every scholar, Arcanist, and priest must learn: the Source and the divine are separate beasts.

No known shaping twists faith into power. No blessing fuels interstellar jumps or bends wormholes. An Arcanist’s will and mind bind raw reality — a priest’s voice and heart do not. Some faithful have tried. They stand at Wells, chanting ancient prayers, hoping the anomalies will answer them like the Source answers trained Navigators. They walk away unchanged — or worse, they lose the same faith that brought them to a Well in the first place.

Yet hints of awareness linger. Some blessings sharpen the senses of the faithful — let them feel the approach of an Arcanist like cold static under the skin. A handful of blessed warriors fought duelists who bent the Source, surviving wounds that would gut an ordinary soldier. But the boundary holds: no divine spell replaces the brutal neural grind of mastering the Source.

A few believers span both worlds — Arcanists who pray nightly to gods they trust more than their own mind’s limits. Some claim these dual paths give them an edge: clearer dreams, steadier hands, a whisper of comfort in the black silence of jump lanes. But no lab, no prophet, no high priest has ever cracked open the truth behind these overlaps. The Source remains the Source. The gods remain the gods. And if they share a heartbeat, they share no words about it.

---

**Forgotten, Sleeping, Never Dead**

The Gaia known gods are only the ones that speak — the ones who grant signs, slip dreams into the sleeping, stir storms and quiet prayers. But belief knows how to dig deeper. Among hidden sects and secret texts, whispers float that other gods wait — beings who once spoke but fell silent when worship faded. Powers that could bloom anew if only the right pilgrim lights a candle in the right ruin.

No record shows a god truly dying. Faith shrinks to nothing, temples crumble, priesthoods scatter — but the myths say that when the last devotee breathes a name, the spark flares back to life. A single fervent mind is tinder enough. Some cults chase this idea like moths to a flame. They hunt Wells, thought to hide sleeping gods, offer blood to the void, twist commandments hoping to catch a flicker of something older than the current pantheons.

So far, no hidden god has stepped back into the light — at least not in any form governments would admit exists. But deep-space survey logs sometimes vanish from archives. Black ships disappear in uncharted anomalies. And the next day, a prophet drifts into a mining station airlock, mouth full of riddles about voices that hum beneath the crust.

---

**The Final Truth of Faith**

For all its marble spires, its basement altars slick with blood, its blessings stitched into war medals and whispered into dying ears — faith remains an open-ended riddle. It soothes and provokes. It explains nothing but makes existence bearable. It raises tyrants and saints, forgives monsters if they kneel just right.

The gods speak just enough to keep hope alive. Their silence leaves enough blank pages for humans to write every excuse, every prayer, every story that explains away chaos when steel cracks or crops fail.

And yet, in this vast cold where the Source carves holes in physics and domes cling to rocks against black vacuum, the faithful cling harder than ever. Because when the airlock seals, the ship hull groans, and the fragile human mind looks too long into nothing — even a silent god is better than no god at all.

## TECHNOLOGY

**The Iron Spine of the Future**

Humanity’s push into the void never ran on belief alone. Faith keeps the mind steady, Arcana bends physics when the mind is strong enough — but neither grows crops in alien soil nor keeps an orbital hull sealed against vacuum. For that, there’s technology: millions of machines big and small, basic and forbidden, legal and black market — the iron spine that lets fragile flesh crawl from Gaia’s soil and dig its claws into worlds that were never ours.

Every human carries it, lives in it, sells parts of themselves for more of it. From slum tenements under the neon haze of Core spires to drift stations orbiting poisoned rocks, technology is the only thing that turns a cold void into a home — and often the tool that strips it away again. It feeds, spies, protects, enslaves, cures, kills. It’s humanity’s greatest equalizer and its sharpest divide.

No colony grows without it. No corporation expands without selling it. No rebellion lasts a cycle if it can’t steal or jury-rig it. In the Ashes of Gaia, tech isn’t just survival. It’s the measure of who owns tomorrow — and how long they can hold it.

---

**Everyday Machines**

At the base of it all sits the MetaNet — the digital bloodstream connecting billions of lives across light-years. It’s not neat, not tidy — more patchwork than perfection. Signals crawl across slipstreams on ARCS ships, bounce between relay drones, spool through aging fiber hidden in walls that haven’t seen maintenance in decades. Propaganda, market crashes, pirate streams, corporate contracts — all run on this invisible nervous system.

No human goes far without a link. A wrist chip — ID, bank account, medical record — hums under the skin, scanned at every checkpoint, store, and orbital dock. Lose your wrist chip, and you’re a ghost: can’t pay for water, can’t board a maglev, can’t prove you exist. Hack it, and you can be anyone — until you’re caught and your real identity is deleted alongside the fake.

Phones, AR lenses, nose filters — the basic kit shifts by world. On Core Worlds with sanitized air and curated climates, a pair of augmented lenses might be your only nod to tech: overlays for news, work, and pleasure, always on, always streaming. On a fringe outpost where alien pollen can shred your lungs overnight, you never step outside without filters strapped tight. On mining rigs buried deep under irradiated crust, your comm-link doubles as a life monitor — a silent alarm if the rock shifts wrong.

Food printers churn out rations when local flora would kill you quicker than vacuum. High-end printers hum in corporate towers, serving designer steaks and boutique booze to execs who’ve never set foot on soil. For the masses, a printer means you won’t starve — but you’ll never taste what real meat was like on old Gaia.

And always, the class divide runs sharp. The rich wear custom implants that sync thought to devices with a flick of a nerve. The poor buy knockoff rigs scraped from black market supply chains — secondhand limbs with glitchy motors, chips stripped from corpses, warranty void the second you bolt it in. Function comes first, safety second, morality dead last.

---

**Cybernetics**

Once, losing a limb was a tragedy. Now, it’s a chance to upgrade — if you can pay. The line between flesh and metal has blurred so far it barely exists in some districts. On Core Worlds, the average desk worker might carry nothing more than a neural implant to boost memory or filter stress hormones. On fringe mining moons, a day laborer might replace both arms before thirty — too many accidents, too few safety checks, and an unspoken expectation that you work until you break again.

Jobs with higher pay often come bundled with higher cost. Corporations lure recruits with contracts that include fresh cybernetics — retina upgrades to spot microfractures, subdermal plating to survive industrial accidents, processors for real-time language feeds. But every implant means debt. Fail to deliver on your contract and your gear is repossessed. In some places, so are the pieces it’s fused to.

Acceptance of cybernetics splits along cultural lines. In Core cities, heavy augmentation is fashionable if discreet. Replace too much skin with steel and you stand out — a curiosity or a threat, depending on who’s watching. Out in the colonies, nobody cares what you look like, only whether the parts work. A good arm that can lift twice its weight means food on the table. A cheap one means risk — but it’s that or no arm at all.

Black market parts keep entire sectors alive. Some are cheap knockoffs, stamped in half-legal factories and shipped in crates marked “agricultural equipment.” Others are stripped straight from unwilling donors — a backroom chop job that ends in someone walking out stronger and someone else dumped in a recycling tank.

For some, steel is a calling. Cults of modification thrive in underworld markets: worshippers of flesh-forged perfection who believe the organic body is a lie to be discarded piece by piece. They meet in back alley clinics, swapping out flesh for plating, nerve clusters for fiber optic spines. Some even sell sensory feeds of their surgeries to feed the VR markets. Flesh is weak, they say — only the machine endures.

---

**Medicine & Bioengineering**

In the Ashes of Gaia, your body is as strong as your wallet. The greatest killers of old Earth — cancer, degenerative disease, fatal organ failures — bend to nanite treatments, targeted gene therapies, bio-sculpting. The wealthy get early detection embedded in their bloodstream: swarms of medical drones whisper data to implants, catching cell mutations before they multiply.

For everyone else, disease is just another debt trap. A tumor spotted late means choices: a loan you’ll never repay, a contract that demands your loyalty until you drop, or a slow fade if you can’t find a friendly neighborhood Biomancer willing to bend the Source to pull you back from the edge — assuming you trust one.

Genetic engineering has never shaken the shadow of its worst abuses. The sins of rogue Biomancers — spliced horrors, lab-grown slave races, engineered soldiers who didn’t survive their own birth — still scar the collective mind. The Protectorate locks down genetic experimentation so tight that designer babies remain more rumor than reality. The idea of a parent tweaking a child’s genome is heresy in some regions, capital crime in others.

Whispers drift through the dark corners of MetaNet: secret corporate vaults where gene-hackers carve out illegal super-soldiers, or fringe cults breeding “pureborn” children to carry the next generation of saints or soldiers. But when the lights come on, proof is rare — and anyone caught looking too closely tends to vanish into quiet detainment.

---

**Infrastructure & Transit**

On the ground, maglevs are the arteries of the Core — fast, cheap, and clean enough to ferry millions from glass towers to orbital lifts and back. Where cities sprawl into cavernous megastructures, maglev lines spiderweb overhead while underground conduits hum with cargo drones feeding the hungry mouth of industry.

Hover cars exist — but don’t expect to see a traffic jam of flying sedans over Core capitals. Airspace belongs to licensed elites and corporate fleets. Let the masses stick to rails, wheels, or their own weary feet.

In orbit, vast lift shafts punch through the atmosphere, hauling payloads too costly for rockets alone. Stations bloom in clusters around them — commercial hubs, slum rings, secret labs where corporations test what’s too illegal for planetary eyes.

Between planets, travel lives and dies by ARCS ships and jump points. Civilian shuttles drift between orbital clusters and gas mining rigs. Luxury liners float along designated routes, hawking exotic vistas and zero-G playgrounds to the upper crust. But tickets cost — and cheap ones rarely guarantee safety when pirates, faulty ship AI, or unstable jump between stars wait for an easy mark.

Derelicts drift at the edges of sensor range — old stations abandoned when the cost outweighed the yield, rigs left to rot when the core minerals gave out, ships that never came home after some interstellar jump calculation twisted wrong. The bold pick them clean or turn them into hideouts. The unlucky get sucked into dark rumors — entire crews found frozen mid-motion, systems humming with malware that grins back through camera feeds.

---

**Weapons & Defense**

In the Ashes of Gaia, a gun is never just a gun — it’s a marker of trust, fear, or desperation. Conventional firearms still rule most street corners and frontier outposts: slug-throwers, polymer pistols, cheap stamped submachine guns. Ammunition factories run day and night to feed the endless cycle of petty crime, corporate security, and cold civil wars.

Above them stand coil guns and rail rifles — electromagnetic weapons that punch neat holes through reinforced bulkheads. Expensive, fragile, often reserved for specialists and mercenaries who know how to keep them clean and fed with the rare magnetic ammo they demand.

Energy weapons flicker into sight when the budget allows. Laser rifles cut silent lines through vacuum, searing hull breaches if aimed wrong — making them as dangerous for the wielder as the target in a cramped orbital corridor. Plasma weapons lurk at the bleeding edge: unstable, ruinously costly, and prone to catastrophic failure when a cheap capacitor shorts mid-battle. Still, when you need to punch a hole through the wall, or a human, there ain't no better choice.

Melee never quite dies. Atomically sharpened monoblades can split alloy with a steady hand. Shock batons hum in the hands of security drones and riot cops who’d rather bruise than kill — but know how easy a miscalculation can fry someone’s heart on contact.

Defense tech balances paranoia with practicality. Stealth cloaks exist in whispers and black market leaks: textile mesh that bends light and thermal output enough to fool a drone, though not forever. Drone jammers hum in corporate vaults, snuffing out spy bots before they squeal secrets to the highest bidder. Energy shields? Engineers keep promising breakthroughs — but every test fails when the math hits the void. Only Arcanists make true barriers worth fearing, and they don’t do ship-wide contracts.

---

**Automation & Labor**

Automation promised freedom — but the void still runs on flesh and sweat. Building a humanoid workforce that doesn’t break under shifting gravity, cosmic radiation, or the simple chaos of human improvisation costs too much for most employers. So the poor stay cheaper than drones.

On Core Worlds and high-tier colonies, mundane tasks are handled by bots and semi-autonomous rigs: maintenance crawlers that patch microfractures, sanitation drones that clean orbital ring corridors, simple warehouse arms that sort endless shipments. But the human cost stays woven in. Someone runs diagnostics. Someone fixes the bots when they glitch. Someone stands by to pull the plug when an AI spins a bad loop.

On frontier rocks and low-budget colonies, the equation flips. Shipping thousands of tons of drone parts and maintenance gear isn’t worth the cargo space — so humans labor instead, breathing thin air in dome farms, swinging hammers in half-finished habitats, drilling ore seams by hand when corporate cost models say automation won’t pay off for another generation.

Debt binds them tight. Corporations offer relocation packages: a ticket to a new life among the stars, in exchange for years of contract labor that never quite covers the interest on the voyage. Fail to work, and the debt stays with your kids.

---

**MetaNet & Surveillance**

No matter where you run, the MetaNet runs faster. Every message, every credit transfer, every pulse of news or propaganda floats on its currents. In theory, it’s free — a public domain stretching between stars. In practice, every sector of the Net bristles with watchers: Protectorate censors scrubbing radical calls for rebellion; corporate filters burying whistleblowers under torrents of targeted ads and misinformation.

Information moves slow between stars — unless you pay for a premium data corridor on an ARCS jump. Whole pirate crews make their living smuggling terabytes of embargoed data through slipstreams, hawking corporate secrets and blackmail caches to the highest bidder.

Every citizen carries the Net in their skin. ID chips under the wrist double as keys, wallets, trackers. Officially, they keep you safe: proof of identity, access to credits, medical info if you drop unconscious in the street. Unofficially, they make you a line in a government spreadsheet — your location, purchases, travel routes, always a scan away for any bored cop or corporate snitch with clearance.

Some trade freedom for convenience. Others hack their chips to slip between identities, forging fresh accounts when the old ones sour. And some slip the chips out altogether, carving themselves out of the grid — but good luck buying lunch or boarding a shuttle without it.

---

**Culture & Subcultures**

Tech doesn’t just shape how people live — it shapes who they are.

Hackers swarm every corner of the MetaNet, more religion than profession. Some do it for pay — data theft, corporate blackmail, sabotage on contract. Others do it for ideology: free the information, wreck the systems that chain human minds. A few just like watching the world burn.

Cults of augmentation rise in shadows and neon-lit basements. The faithful trade skin for chrome, worship perfection through the slow strip of flesh. They livestream surgeries, run networks trading black market parts, praise the day they’ll shed all organic weakness and ascend into something immortal and steel.

Countercultures push back. Naturalist sects see the cybernetic body as an insult to the flesh the gods gave. Some just preach, shunning tech in protest. Others act: raids on black market clinics, bombings of cybernetics showrooms, kidnappings of high-profile modders who vanish into unmarked crates bound for nowhere.

And the soft edge of it all: people chasing connection through wires. Lovers who share memory feeds spliced from neural eyes, reliving first kisses on loop until the truth blurs. Virtual courtesans selling affection coded line by line. VR dreamers chasing synthetic intimacy when the real world grows too sharp to hold.

---

**Psychology & Mental Strain**

Human brains were never built for endless signals. Now they hum on it every waking second.

Deep space isolation breeds a special kind of quiet madness. Colonists drift months between stars in tiny coffin-bunks, no fresh air, no sun. Core planets hum with light and noise — but deep inside corporate arcologies, people die without ever touching real soil or seeing an open sky.

VR addiction gnaws at the edges. A cheap neural rig promises whole new worlds: a better lover, a cleaner street, a life with fewer debts and brighter colors. Strip off the rig and reality feels stale — so people stay plugged in until their bodies waste and their minds drift into permanent loops.

Drugs patch the gaps. Stims for the work shift. Suppressants to keep your heart from exploding when your cybernetics override your own limits. Designer pills for Arcanists who’ve bent their synapses too far. Underground chem-labs for everyone else.

Even the toughest mods have limits. The more flesh you trade for steel, the more the mind strains to hold the wiring in place. Black market full-body conversions breed legends of cyborgs who forget they were human — running on half-broken loops of old memory and new hardware.

**Control & Power**

At the top of the tech food chain sit the same old titans: mega-corps, Protectorate branches, a web of regulators pretending to hold the line while selling favors to the highest bidder.

Starships capable of slipstream jumps are built in state-monitored yards or corporate mega-factories under the heaviest security the galaxy can buy. The secret codes that bind an ARCS-class vessel to its Navigator never leave vaults buried deep in orbital foundries. Even rebels smart enough to steal a hull can’t jump far without the licensed mind to bend reality around it.

Food synthesis tech that makes alien soil edible? Trademarked and leased at prices that keep colonies just solvent enough to keep paying. The same corporate directors who sign off on cargo runs also sign off on import taxes for food printers — a tidy loop that fattens dividends while settlers scrape by on ration paste and questionable off-brand flavor packs.

Hackers poke holes where they can — snagging encryption keys, leaking blueprints, selling sabotage software that flickers past corporate firewalls long enough to shred security systems from the inside out. Rebels cobble gear from surplus, bribed warehouse clerks, or backdoor deals with disgraced ex-military officers. Every stolen shipment keeps a hundred people alive for one more skirmish — or funds the next bomb in a back alley somewhere on the map.

**Disasters & Ghosts in the Machine**

No tech stays safe forever. The more complex the grid, the worse it breaks.

Neural viruses slip through old ports and half-patched implants, frying synapses when they hit the wrong node. Whole slums go dark when faulty AI hijacks local maintenance bots, welding doors shut and turning service drones into makeshift sentries for reasons no human can decode.

Mass data leaks spark riots when a city’s secret debts spill onto public feeds. Blackouts collapse orbital elevators — not from sabotage, just from the wear of tech never built to run this long without maintenance.

Old stations drift on the edge of mapped space, their last pings ghosted by corporate censors. Explorers find them gutted — hulls intact, crew frozen at their posts, logs corrupted by code that hums like a chant when decrypted. Some ships' crews swear they’ve heard those signals echo through the void, like a dead crew’s final message clawing at the walls of reality.

**Arcana & Technology**

For all the black budgets poured into hybrid labs and forbidden experiments, one truth keeps clawing its way back to the top: the Source does not run on wires.

No machine, no matter how sleek, can shape the Source alone. The biggest reactors, the most cunning neural grafts, the deepest code — they all hit the same wall. The Source demands a living mind, a will precise enough to balance reality’s cruel equations in real time. When flesh fails, the pattern fails. Machines can amplify the Arcanist’s reach — stabilize a slipstream jump, buffer a Navigator’s mind as they bend wormholes around hulls the size of cities. But the machine can’t replace the mind.

Academies and Protectorate regulators keep a watchful eye on any corporation that brags too loud about “self-navigating ARCS ships” or “automated shaping rigs.” The labs that try always end the same: burned-out hulls, containment breaches, bodies left half-fused to hardware when the Source punishes hubris.

Rumors say the darkest fringe cults still chase the dream. Stories drift from half-broken outposts: rogue Arcanists who place their brains into ship cores, hoping to live forever as flesh-and-circuit Navigators. Black sites where hijacked Wells spots are chained to processors instead of minds. Whispered logs that claim a ghost AI from beyond mapped slipstreams — a weaving pattern that outlived its shaper.

No evidence survives. Just cold wreckage, corrupted code, and the Academy’s quiet policy of striking every scrap from the record.

In the day-to-day, tech and Arcana coexist by staying in separate lanes. Terraformers might use shaped matter to stabilize a rock’s core — then local engineers bolt reactors on top. An orbital city floats thanks to graviturgy, but its life support hums with mundane filters and patchwork ducts. The line is sharp: the Source bends physics where brute force can’t — and tech stitches that bend into something that works until it breaks again.
No one’s cracked a better bargain yet.

**Final Truth**

Zoom out far enough and the galaxy looks like a promise wrapped in circuit and alloy. Crops grown on airless moons. Cities orbiting dead planets that never knew organic life. Networks that bind billions of minds into one endless, screaming conversation. Metal arms that lift twice what bone ever could. Ships that slip through holes in physics, jump lanes bent around them by willpower alone.

But the cost is always the same: debt in some form — to a company, a regulator, a creed, or the simple physics of keeping skin and alloy alive where the void wants both dead.

Tech promises to be free. It also binds. A new prosthetic arm works until you miss a payment. A perfect lung filter saves your life until your contract says you work double shifts breathing poisoned dust to cover the price. An orbital habitat holds air until a skipped maintenance cycle leaves a crack that no engineer spots in time.

Humans shape machines. Machines shape humans back — in flesh, in thought, in dreams. Augmentation cults cut deeper every cycle. VR addicts forget their own bodies for lives they can’t afford in the waking world. Corporations write new flesh into law, then harvest it when the ledger says it’s time.

Some slip the chains. Hackers crack chips, rebels hijack supply lines, fringe colonies build breakaway rigs that spin their own oxygen and spit on corporate patent codes. But the noose never vanishes entirely. The void waits. The airlock always opens when the money runs out.

Arcana bends reality for a price. Faith bends the soul for a promise. Technology does both at once — and demands a mortgage in skin, credits, and the hope that tomorrow’s parts won’t fail before you do.
In the Ashes of Gaia, every tool is freedom for someone — and a leash for someone else.
And nobody holds the leash forever.

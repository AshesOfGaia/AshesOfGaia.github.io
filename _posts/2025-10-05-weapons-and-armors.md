## Weapons Qualities

|     Quality     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|    ADVANCED     |                                                                                                                                 This weapon represents the peak of current technology. Because of its complexity, it is very difficult to repair if damaged or jammed. Repairing or unjamming requires a Hard Weapon Skill check and spending one action.                                                                                                                                 |
|   ANTI-ARMOR    |                                                                                                                                                    Designed for maximum armor penetration (either built in or as a melee property). All attacks with this weapon halve the target’s armor rating for the purpose of damage resolution.                                                                                                                                                    |
|     BRUTAL      |                                                                                                                                                                                      When wielded two-handed, this weapon uses double the normal Damage Modifier (instead of the standard modifier).                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  BULLET-STORM   |                                                                                                                                                              This weapon has an extremely high rate of fire. A skilled shooter may spend two actions and 20 rounds to add +1 die to the weapon’s damage roll for that burst.                                                                                                                                                              |
|     BULLPUP     |                                                                                                                                                                                     A bullpup-configured weapon does not suffer penalties associated with long, heavy arms in short-distance combat.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|   CONCEALABLE   |                                                                                                                                                                          If someone attempts to discover this weapon on a character (search/spot/hidden check), the seeker suffers a –20 penalty to that check.                                                                                                                                                                           |
|   CUMBERSOME    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This weapon reduces the wielder’s movement rate by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|   DISPERSION    |                                                                                                                                                         Weapons with this trait list damage as Standard / Long range values. When attacking, apply the damage value that corresponds to the target’s distance (Standard or Long).                                                                                                                                                         |
|      FIRE       |                                                                                           When a target is hit by a weapon with this trait and the hit deals at least 1 point of damage, the target must make a Luck check. On success they take the weapon’s normal damage only; on failure they catch fire and take 2d6 damage each round until they spend two actions to put out the flames.                                                                                           |
|  FRAGMENTATION  | Explosive weapons suffer damage falloff by concentric 5-meter bands from the center of the blast: 0–5 m: full damage / 5–10 m: ¾ of original damage / 10–15 m: ½ of original damage / 15–20 m: ¼ of original damage. Beyond 20 m the explosive deals no damage. Each character within the explosion may attempt a Dodge check; each degree of success reduces damage taken by 1d6. Using multiple explosives together increases the base damage by +1 die and extends range by +5 meters. |
|    GRUESOME     |                                                                                                                                                                                   Wounds caused by this weapon cannot be healed with a simple First Aid check; they require a Medicine check to treat.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|    HEAVY (X)    |                                                                                                        This weapon is heavy to wield. It requires STR X or more to use without penalty. If the wielder’s STR is lower than X, they suffer –30 to attack rolls with this weapon. To avoid the penalty the user must brace the weapon first (take the appropriate action to brace).                                                                                                         |
|    INDIRECT     |                                                                                                This weapon can engage targets that are not in a straight line of sight (for example, firing around cover or into an obscured area). Attacks made this way suffer –30 to the ranged attack check. On a failed check, determine where the shot landed using a random direction/impact table.                                                                                                |
|   INSTANT-HIT   |                                                                                          When dodging an attack from a weapon with this trait, a defender must achieve a higher degree of success on their Dodge check than the attacker achieved on the attack. The ammunition either fills too much space to dodge or travels so fast that near-instant reactions are effectively impossible.                                                                                           |
|    OVERLOAD     |                                                                                                            You may expend five times the ammunition required for a single shot to gain one of the following for that shot (single-shot weapons only): Double the weapon’s range for the shot, or Add +1 die to the damage roll (e.g., a 3d6 weapon becomes 4d6 for that shot).                                                                                                            |
|     POISON      |                                                                                                                                                      This weapon can be loaded with poisons or drugs. When it deals at least 1 HP of damage, the target must make the Constitution check specified by the poison/drug’s description.                                                                                                                                                      |
|     PRECISE     |                                                                                                                                           This weapon is built for single, lethal shots. For success degrees above a Simple/Basic success, the attacker gains bonus damage as follows: Normal success +1, Hard success +2, Extreme success +4.                                                                                                                                            |
|      SHOCK      |                                                                                                                                                        If a target is hit and takes at least 1 point of damage from this weapon, they must make a Constitution check at –20. On failure the target is stunned for 5 combat rounds.                                                                                                                                                        |
|      SLOW       |                                                                                                                                                                    Because of its design, this weapon can be fired only once per turn. After each shot the user must spend an action to manually load the next round.                                                                                                                                                                     |
|      SLUG       |                                                                                                                                                  This weapon can fire large solid projectiles (slugs) instead of its standard ammunition. When using slug ammo, change the weapon’s damage to 2d8 and its effective range to 50 meters.                                                                                                                                                   |
| SURFACE-TO-AIR  |                                                                                                                                            This weapon is intended only for engaging air targets (helicopters, jets, drones, etc.). If used against a ground target, treat its range as that of a light anti-tank weapon and apply –30 to hit.                                                                                                                                            |
| SURPRISE-HITTER |                                                                                                                                  Shots from this weapon are hard to trace back to their source. Any Spot/Hidden check to locate a hidden shooter using this weapon must achieve a higher degree of success than the hiding shooter did to remain hidden.                                                                                                                                  |

When attacking a vehicle with this trait, calculate damage against the vehicle’s top armor (top armor is treated the same as rear/back armor for this purpose).                                                                                                                               |

It operates under automated targeting software; X replaces the normal weapon skill when making attack checks. The turret can be programmed with target priorities or simple behavioral scripts.                                                                                                    |

## Weapons Table

**CONVENTIONAL:** Conventional Weapons represent the broadest and most enduring category of ranged armaments, encompassing everything from modern automatic rifles and precision sniper systems to classic revolvers and bolt-action rifles of earlier centuries. What unites them is their reliance on chemical propellants—typically gunpowder or advanced synthetic charges—to fire solid projectiles through explosive expansion and pressure.

These weapons vary widely in design, sophistication, and purpose: from rugged, old-world firearms passed down through generations to state-of-the-art assault systems integrating cutting-edge materials, smart optics, and stabilized recoil mechanics. Despite the rise of energy and magnetic weaponry, conventional firearms remain reliable, versatile, and easy to maintain, making them a staple for soldiers, mercenaries, and survivalists alike.

Their power lies in simplicity—mechanical precision and chemical energy working in harmony to deliver deadly results. In a universe of complex technologies, conventional weapons endure as a timeless testament to efficiency, adaptability, and lethal practicality.

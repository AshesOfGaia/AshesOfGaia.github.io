## Weapons Qualities

Below you can see a full list of all melee and range weapons qualities:

| Quality | Description |
| :-----: | :---------: |
| ADVANCED | This weapon represents the peak of current technology. Because of its complexity, it is very difficult to repair if damaged or jammed. Repairing or unjamming requires a Hard Weapon Skill check and spending one action. |
| ANTI-ARMOR | Designed for maximum armor penetration (either built in or as a melee property). All attacks with this weapon halve the target’s armor rating for the purpose of damage resolution. |
| BRUTAL | When wielded two-handed, this weapon uses double the normal Damage Modifier (instead of the standard modifier). |
| BULLET-STORM | This weapon has an extremely high rate of fire. A skilled shooter may spend two actions and 20 rounds to add +1 die to the weapon’s damage roll for that burst. |
| BULLPUP | A bullpup-configured weapon does not suffer penalties associated with long, heavy arms in short-distance combat. |
| CONCEALABLE | If someone attempts to discover this weapon on a character (search/spot/hidden check), the seeker suffers a –20 penalty to that check. |
| CUMBERSOME | This weapon reduces the wielder’s movement rate by 1. |
| DISPERSION | Weapons with this trait list damage as Standard / Long range values. When attacking, apply the damage value that corresponds to the target’s distance (Standard or Long). |
| FIRE | When a target is hit by a weapon with this trait and the hit deals at least 1 point of damage, the target must make a Luck check. On success they take the weapon’s normal damage only; on failure they catch fire and take 2d6 damage each round until they spend two actions to put out the flames. |
| FRAGMENTATION | Explosive weapons suffer damage falloff by concentric 5-meter bands from the center of the blast: 0–5 m: full damage / 5–10 m: ¾ of original damage / 10–15 m: ½ of original damage / 15–20 m: ¼ of original damage. Beyond 20 m the explosive deals no damage. Each character within the explosion may attempt a Dodge check; each degree of success reduces damage taken by 1d6. Using multiple explosives together increases the base damage by +1 die and extends range by +5 meters. |
| GRUESOME | Wounds caused by this weapon cannot be healed with a simple First Aid check; they require a Medicine check to treat. |
| HEAVY (X) | This weapon is heavy to wield. It requires STR X or more to use without penalty. If the wielder’s STR is lower than X, they suffer –30 to attack rolls with this weapon. To avoid the penalty the user must brace the weapon first (take the appropriate action to brace). |
| INDIRECT | This weapon can engage targets that are not in a straight line of sight (for example, firing around cover or into an obscured area). Attacks made this way suffer –30 to the ranged attack check. On a failed check, determine where the shot landed using a random direction/impact table. |
| INSTANT-HIT | When dodging an attack from a weapon with this trait, a defender must achieve a higher degree of success on their Dodge check than the attacker achieved on the attack. The ammunition either fills too much space to dodge or travels so fast that near-instant reactions are effectively impossible. |
| OVERLOAD | You may expend five times the ammunition required for a single shot to gain one of the following for that shot (single-shot weapons only): Double the weapon’s range for the shot, or Add +1 die to the damage roll (e.g., a 3d6 weapon becomes 4d6 for that shot). |
| POISON | This weapon can be loaded with poisons or drugs. When it deals at least 1 HP of damage, the target must make the Constitution check specified by the poison/drug’s description. |
| PRECISE | This weapon is built for single, lethal shots. For success degrees above a Simple/Basic success, the attacker gains bonus damage as follows: Normal success +1, Hard success +2, Extreme success +4. |
| SHOCK | If a target is hit and takes at least 1 point of damage from this weapon, they must make a Constitution check at –20. On failure the target is stunned for 5 combat rounds. |
| SLOW | Because of its design, this weapon can be fired only once per turn. After each shot the user must spend an action to manually load the next round. |
| SLUG | This weapon can fire large solid projectiles (slugs) instead of its standard ammunition. When using slug ammo, change the weapon’s damage to 2d8 and its effective range to 50 meters. |
| SURFACE-TO-AIR | This weapon is intended only for engaging air targets (helicopters, jets, drones, etc.). If used against a ground target, treat its range as that of a light anti-tank weapon and apply –30 to hit. |
| SURPRISE-HITTER | Shots from this weapon are hard to trace back to their source. Any Spot/Hidden check to locate a hidden shooter using this weapon must achieve a higher degree of success than the hiding shooter did to remain hidden. |
| TOP-HITTER | This weapon is optimized to strike the top armor of vehicles. When attacking a vehicle with this trait, calculate damage against the vehicle’s top armor (top armor is treated the same as rear/back armor for this purpose). |
| TURRET (X) | This weapon is designed for mounted/automated emplacements rather than personal use. It operates under automated targeting software; X replaces the normal weapon skill when making attack checks. The turret can be programmed with target priorities or simple behavioral scripts. |
| TRUSTED | If this weapon jams, it can be unjammed by spending one action — no Weapon Skill check required. |
| UNDAMAGING | Typically a melee quality: weapons with this trait do not ignore half of the target’s armor rating. |


## Weapons Table

| TABLE ELEMENT  | DESCRIPTION |
| :------------: | :---------: |
|      Name      | The official designation or model name of the weapon, used to identify it during gameplay. |
|     Damage     | Represents the weapon’s lethality and determines the type and number of dice a player rolls when dealing damage with it. |
|   Damage type  | Describes the nature of the damage inflicted (e.g., Piercing, Energy, Primitive). This determines how the attack interacts with the target’s armor and how effective the weapon is against different armor types or ratings. |
|     Range      | Defines the effective distance at which the weapon can accurately strike a target. There are three range categories: Normal, Long, and Extreme. Normal Range: As listed in the weapon’s profile. Long Range: Double the normal range; all attack rolls suffer a –30 penalty. Extreme Range: Triple the normal range; all attack rolls suffer a –60 penalty. |
|     Impale     | Indicates whether the weapon can inflict critical damage when a character scores a critical success on their attack roll. Critical damage doubles the number of dice rolled for damage. Not all weapons are capable of causing critical (impale) hits. |
| Hand Necessary | The number of hands required to properly wield the weapon (e.g., 1H or 2H). Using a two-handed weapon with only one hand imposes a –30 penalty on all weapon skill checks made with it. |
|     Reload     | The number of actions required to completely reload the weapon’s magazine, chamber, or cylinder. |
|  Rate of fire  | Indicates how many attacks the weapon can make per turn and which firing modes it supports (Single / Semi-Auto / Full-Auto). The first value shows how many rounds, charges, or bolts are expended per attack. The second value shows the modifier applied to the corresponding weapon skill check. If a firing mode is marked with “—”, that option is not available for the weapon. |
|    Magazine    | The maximum number of rounds, charges, or bolts the weapon can hold before reloading. Some weapons can use extended magazines to increase this capacity. |
|     Jamming    | The roll range that causes the weapon to jam or malfunction when fired. Unjamming a weapon requires 1 action and a successful weapon skill check. |
|     Weight     | The weapon’s mass, measured in pounds; affects encumbrance and mobility. |
|      Price     | The weapon’s market value, listed in credits. Prices may vary depending on location, availability, and seller. |
|    Qualities   | Special traits or unique properties that influence how the weapon performs in combat (e.g., Trusted, Advanced, Overload). |

## Concentional Weapons

Conventional Weapons represent the broadest and most enduring category of ranged armaments, encompassing everything from modern automatic rifles and precision sniper systems to classic revolvers and bolt-action rifles of earlier centuries. What unites them is their reliance on chemical propellants—typically gunpowder or advanced synthetic charges—to fire solid projectiles through explosive expansion and pressure.

These weapons vary widely in design, sophistication, and purpose: from rugged, old-world firearms passed down through generations to state-of-the-art assault systems integrating cutting-edge materials, smart optics, and stabilized recoil mechanics. Despite the rise of energy and magnetic weaponry, conventional firearms remain reliable, versatile, and easy to maintain, making them a staple for soldiers, mercenaries, and survivalists alike.

Their power lies in simplicity—mechanical precision and chemical energy working in harmony to deliver deadly results. In a universe of complex technologies, conventional weapons endure as a timeless testament to efficiency, adaptability, and lethal practicality.

## Energy Weapons

Energy weapons harness directed beams of coherent light, plasma, or focused radiation to deliver devastating precision and speed. Unlike conventional firearms that rely on chemical propellants, these weapons use high-density energy cells or compact reactors to project their payload at near-instant velocities, making them exceptionally accurate and nearly impossible to evade once fired.

This category encompasses a wide range of armaments—from sleek laser pistols and rifles designed for infantry use, to heavy plasma cannons capable of melting through armored plating. Their projectiles leave no ballistic trajectory or shell casings, only the scorched aftermath of concentrated energy impact.

Energy weapons are prized for their pinpoint accuracy, minimal recoil, and clean operation, though they demand strict power management and regular maintenance due to heat buildup and emitter wear. Whether used in advanced militaries or by elite strike units, they embody the pinnacle of high-technology warfare—silent, efficient, and lethally precise.

## Electroagnetic Weapons

Electromagnetic Weapons utilize powerful magnetic fields to accelerate solid projectiles to extreme velocities, combining cutting-edge physics with brutal kinetic efficiency. This category includes both railguns—which propel rounds along conductive rails using direct electromagnetic force—and coilguns, which use sequential magnetic coils to launch projectiles with silent precision and devastating power.

Unlike conventional firearms, electromagnetic weapons require no chemical propellant. Instead, they rely on energy cells or capacitor banks to generate immense bursts of electrical current, converting raw energy into pure momentum. The result is a weapon capable of piercing armor, breaching fortified structures, or striking distant targets with pinpoint accuracy.

Though they offer exceptional range, velocity, and penetration, electromagnetic systems demand significant power reserves and cooling, making them more suited to advanced militaries, mechanized units, or specialized marksmen. In skilled hands, these weapons represent the perfect blend of scientific innovation and raw destructive force—the future of ballistic warfare.

## Thermal Weapons

Thermal Weapons harness the destructive force of heat, from advanced plasma guns to classic flamethrowers. Rather than relying on kinetic energy, they devastate targets through searing temperatures capable of melting armor, igniting cover, and reducing flesh to ash.

Plasma weapons project superheated bolts of ionized gas, delivering pinpoint strikes that can burn through even reinforced plating. They excel in raw destructive power but demand strict power regulation and cooling to avoid overloads or reduced performance during prolonged fire.

Flamethrowers and other incendiary systems use streams of ignited fuel to engulf areas in fire, ideal for flushing enemies out or denying terrain. Though limited in range, their simplicity and terror effect make them enduring battlefield tools. Thermal weaponry sacrifices subtlety for overwhelming, fiery devastation.
